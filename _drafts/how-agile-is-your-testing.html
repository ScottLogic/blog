<p>If your project has testing bottlenecks and error-prone releases, then this indicates that the team hasn't effectively embedded an agile culture in their working practices. Instead of using an agile methodology, these projects might actually be taking a more ‘wagile’ approach: ‘waterfall within agile’. </p>

<p>Waterfall project management is the opposite of agile. With waterfall, everything about a project is set at the start of the process, and tasks cascade down through different teams. Tasks and deadlines crash into one another over time, and there is no way to change priorities during the life of the project. The result can be a toxic project – one which is delivered with the wrong features, and to the wrong timescales.</p>

<p>A testing team may look like they’re working in an agile way – perhaps they’re working in sprints, and using Jira. But if the developers are working in isolation for eight days, and then hand it to test at the very end of a sprint, then the reality is that they’re still working in a waterfall framework. Agile should be a continuous flow of outputs from both development and test.</p>

<p>At Scott Logic, agile is fundamentally a way of delivering value early and often – it allows us to deliver a minimal working piece of software in a short amount of time. Agile is fast, iterative, and collaborative. It's also about good communication. From a testing perspective, working in an agile methodology helps our software team understand each other better. Effective and timely communication between testers and developers ensures that our team are actually delivering the right functionality at the right time – a hugely important part of any development cycle.</p>
 
<p>We've put together a guide to help programme managers who are in the process of moving from their teams from a waterfall to an agile way of working, or who already use an agile framework but aren't seeing the full business benefits. It'll give you practical advice on what changes you can make to better integrate testing and development teams, and how to maintain a positive and efficient working practice.</p>
