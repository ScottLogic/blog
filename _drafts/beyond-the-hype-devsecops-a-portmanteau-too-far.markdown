In this episode, Oliver and Peter from Scott Logic are joined by Laura Bell Main, CEO and co-founder of SafeStack, for a lively discussion on DevSecOps. They touch on techniques such as “assume breach” and “shift left”, and the relationship to DevOps, which is trying to solve a similar problem. However, much of the discussion focussed quite simply on security and the challenges this presents, especially when this so often falls to a very small team or an individual.

Laura mentioned [OneHourAppSec](https://safestack.io/one-hour-appsec/) at the end of the recording. It’s a free appsec program that helps software teams worldwide bring security to their software development lifecycle in just one hour per sprint. You can join at any time, from anywhere. She’d love you to check it out.
