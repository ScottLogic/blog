Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at and attend [Data Centre World](https://www.datacentreworld.com/conference-programme) as part of the larger Tech Show London 2025. This massive event sprawled across half of the ExCeL centre, bringing together industry vendors, academics, and innovators across multiple technology domains. While the conference covered loads of topics, I was particularly drawn to sessions focusing on sustainable data centres and AI computing. I did my best to navigate the busy conference floor and attend as many relevant talks as possible!

On the surface much of the messaging at the conference aligned with sustainability themes. Not far off what we've been exploring through [previous blog posts](https://blog.scottlogic.com/ocronk/) and my personal podcast, [Architect Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/@ArchitectTomorrow), where sustainable technology solutions is a common topic. However as always the devil was in the detail and the reality was mixture of best intentions, outright [greenwashing](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/04/15/how-cxos-can-spot-technology-greenwashing.html) through to genuine looking pragmatic progress on making data centres more sustainable.

# The Double-Edged Sword of AI and Computing

Several sessions throughout the conference emphasised a common theme: data centres are a double-edged sword when it comes to sustainability. On one hand, they can enable technologies that can help solve climate change and optimise resource usage. On the other hand, they are significant consumers of energy and resources and there is a massive lack of transparency and accurate data to really understand their real impact.
