Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at and attend [Data Centre World](https://www.datacentreworld.com/conference-programme) as part of the larger Tech Show London 2025. This massive event sprawled across half of the ExCeL centre, bringing together industry vendors, academics, and innovators across multiple technology domains. While the conference covered loads of topics, I was particularly drawn to sessions focusing on sustainable data centres and AI computing. I did my best to navigate the busy conference floor and attend as many relevant talks as possible! 

On the surface much of the messaging at the conference aligned with sustainability themes. Not far off what we've been exploring through [previous blog posts](https://blog.scottlogic.com/ocronk/) and my personal podcast, [Architect Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/@ArchitectTomorrow), where sustainable technology solutions is a common topic. However as always the devil was in the detail and the reality was mixture of best intentions, outright [greenwashing](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/04/15/how-cxos-can-spot-technology-greenwashing.html) through to genuine looking pragmatic progress on making data centres more sustainable.
