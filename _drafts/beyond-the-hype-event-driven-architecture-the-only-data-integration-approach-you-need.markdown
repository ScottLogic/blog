  with Tom Fairbairn from Solace and Scott Logic’s Gordon Campbell. The discussion
  explores whether EDA has matured beyond the hype into a practical strategy for modern
  systems integration, or if it’s just another architectural buzzword.

In this episode, I dive into the world of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with Tom Fairbairn from Solace and Scott Logic’s Gordon Campbell. The discussion explores whether EDA has matured beyond the hype into a practical strategy for modern systems integration, or if it’s just another architectural buzzword.

Together, we unpack the core principles of EDA, its role in taming point-to-point integration chaos, and how asynchronous processing can help smooth demand spikes. Drawing on real-world examples from finance, retail, and public sector projects, our conversation highlights the power and pitfalls of adopting EDA.

Whether you're navigating legacy systems, planning a cloud migration, or exploring AI integration, this episode offers a grounded perspective on when – and when not – to go event-driven.
