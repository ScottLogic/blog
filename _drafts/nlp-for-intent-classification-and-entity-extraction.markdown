summary: Our team has been doing research and development in the NLP / NLG space recently.
  After evaluating several of the major NLP platforms (including those from the major
  cloud providers, we opted for OpenAI GPT-3 for its overall performance and context-aware
  capabilities. Further more integrating GPT-3 with neo4j has allowed us to establish
  a strong and easily updatable knowledgebase for the use cases we have been exploring.

# Intro

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a NLP/NLG (Natural Language Processing/Generation) project that was out of this world! (Well not literally, but close enough!).
To achieve this, I dusted off my NLP books, read some papers and put my natural language processing skills to the test!

# NLP 101 - Intent Classification and Entity Extraction

Before we dive into the comparison of NLP platforms, let's take a moment to understand what **intent classification and entity extraction** are all about. Essentially, these NLP techniques are like playing a game of 20 questions with. The NLP application asks questions to determine what the user **wants** (**intent**) and what specific **information** they're looking for (**entity**).
For example, if a user asks `"What's the weather like in Paris today?"`. The NLP's job is to identify the user's intent as `"weather inquiry"` and extract the entity `"Paris"`.
In a nutshell, NLP is like being a detective, but with AI. And who doesn't love solving a good mystery? With this basic background of NLP covered, let's dive into the comparison of NLP platforms!


# Platforms Comparison - The Battle of the Bots!

In the course of the project, we had to find the most appropriate NLP platform to bring out creation to life. After much research and testing, we narrowed down our options to the following:

* Amazon Comprehend: While it was a strong contender, the intent classification wasn't quite up to our standards right out of the box.

* IBM Watson: Watson was a bit of a challenge as well, as we found that the intent classification wasn't working as seamlessly as we needed it to.

* Azure Cognitive Services: This platform was straightforward and easy to set up, but it was quite basic and didn't support a chat-like system out of the box. It was mostly focused on intent classification and entity extraction.

* AWS Lex: An interesting option would be AWS Lex if it could run seamlessly without its ecosystem. Of course, you could find workarounds using Lambda functions, but it felt like swimming against the flow.

  In the end, we decided to settle on OpenAI GPT-3 thanks to its context-aware capabilities (answering questions and providing useful information) as well as its output in JSON format.
  For example, a JSON response might have looked like this:
  {
  "intent": "weather_inquiry",
  "entities":\[{entity_name: "city", entity_value: "Paris"}\],
  "reply": "The current temperature in Paris is 2Â°C with scattered clouds"
  }
  Keep in mind, working with OpenAI GPT-3 required some knowledge of prompt engineering and testing, but the end result was worth it.

# Conclusion

In conclusion our team ultimately chose OpenAI GPT-3 as the most pragmatic choice for our recent project. It's strong performance in entity extraction and context-aware capabilities made it one of the best options for this particular project. Additionally, our integration of GPT-3 with Neo4J allowed  us to build a knowledge base that could be easily updated and queried. That said it very much depends on the problem that you need to solve and crucially what the existing environment looks like (for example if AWS or Azure is a major component of your existing architecture).

However it's important  to note that this area of technology is moving fast and there are a lot of hyped tools out there! So one of our biggest realisations is that building effective AI systems requires a combination of several components or layers to achieve the desired result.
