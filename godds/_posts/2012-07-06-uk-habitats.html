summary: "Intrigued by Mark Easton's question on Twitter, 'How much of Britain is built on?', and inspired by the associated article, The Great Urban Myth of Britain, I wanted to put the UK NEA's statement that '6.8% of the UK's land area is now classified as urban' into some kind of context that actually made sense to me."

<p>Intrigued by Mark Easton's question on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/BBCMarkEaston/status/218289686597210112" target="_blank">"How much of Britain is built on?"</a>, and inspired by the associated article, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096" target="_blank">The great urban myth of Britain</a>, I wanted to put the <a href="http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/" target="_blank">UK NEA</a>'s statement that "6.8% of the UK's land area is now classified as urban" into some kind of context that actually made sense to me.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that 6.8% of the UK is just short of 2 million football pitches.  Unfortunately, this is still not actually something I can remotely picture (much like <a href="http://johnfinnemore.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/i-am-supposed-to-be-writing-sitcom.html" target="_blank">genuinely imagining more than 10 otters is a tall order</a>).  The best solution I could come up with was to put the information in the context of actual geography:</p>

<p>And here is the original report from which the numbers were sourced, for posterity: <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2012/07/28_06_12_uk_national_ecosystem.pdf'>UK National Ecosystem Assessment</a>.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: I have written a short <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2012/07/12/pretty-pictures">critique of this graphic</a> that also provides some insight into how it was created and the figures behind it.</p>
