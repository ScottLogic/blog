<p>Last month was a busy one for me - I wrote quite a few blog posts, with the Silverlight ones proving very popular,  and added new article posted to <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/DependencyPropertyCodeGen.aspx">codeproject</a>.  I just received an email today notifying me that I was a prize winner in the Community Credit April 2009 awards. And my prize?</p>
<p>... it's Splat Stan!</p>

<p>Just what I needed!</p>
<p>(Now let's see how long it takes for this prize to turn up. I am still waiting for my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2008/12/04/awards-and-other-news">November 2008</a> prize!)</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>
