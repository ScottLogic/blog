<p>Last week I gave a presentation at a joint Scott Logic / Microsoft event about how WPF and Silverlight are unifying the development platform for desktop, web and mobile. To accompany the talk I wrote a white paper which delves into this subject in a little more detail.</p>
<p>You can download the whitepaper here: <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2010/10/WPF-and-Silverlight-Unification.pdf'>WPF and Silverlight Cross Platform Development White Paper</a> (PDF, 1.8 MBytes)</p>
<p>Or view it online in the PDF viewer below: </p>

<p>I also created a cross platform application that has a 75% shared codebase between the WPF (desktop), Silverlight (web) and Windows Phone 7 (mobile) versions. I plan to share more of this at a later date.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, ideas or comments, please share them below.</p>
