<p>OK, so I’m a bit late; it was my intention to write this post at the start of January. However I’ve been a bit busy…which is a good thing!</p>
<p>At the start of 2016 I <a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/insights/most-popular-tech-blog-posts-of-2015">wrote a brief post</a> that shared the most popular topics on our technical blog from the previous year, and here I am to repeat the exercise. </p>
<p>Firstly, the number of visitors to our site has continued to increase. Towards the end of 2015 we exceeded 100,000 visitors per month for the first time; throughout 2016 visits have continued to grow, pushing towards 120,000 per month.</p>
<h2>Strength in numbers</h2>
<p>Looking at some of the other metrics, in 2016 we published:</p>
<ul>
<li>80 blog posts (+12 compared to 2015)</li>
<li>By 32 different authors (+4 compared to 2015)</li>
<li>Including 18 new authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's great to see an increase in the overall number of blog posts and visitors, I’m most pleased with the number of new authors we’ve attracted.</p>
<p>Looking back on 2016 the five most popular blog posts (with visit counts suitably corrected based on the date they were published) were:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/01/20/restful-api-with-aspnet50.html">Building a Restful API with ASP.NET 5</a> - In this post, Nick Soper walks through the process of creating a REST API with ASP.NET 5 (now ASP.NET Core 1.0). This was a very successful post which continues to attract large volumes of traffic, showing that practical posts with clear and simple instructions are very valuable </li>
<li><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/09/05/hosting-netcore-on-linux-with-docker.html">Hosting .NET Core on Linux with Docker</a> - Another one from Nick Soper, this time building on the previous post to demonstrate deployment through Docker</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/11/01/go-particle-simulation.html">Creating a Simple Particle Simulation with Go</a> - Here Will Ferguson shares his experience of learning a new language</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/05/19/redux-reducer-arrays.html">Applying Redux Reducers to Arrays</a> - This is one of my posts, that explores the very popular Redux pattern</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/06/13/code-reuse-in-microservices-architecture.html">Code Re-use in Microservice Architecture with Spring Boot</a> - Last but not least, this post from Bartosz Jedrzejewski explores code re-use within microservices. Another of his posts, <a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/01/05/java-microservices-with-dropwizard-tutorial.html">Java Microservices with Dropwizard</a>, narrowly missed out on a top five slot.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s great to see such a diverse range of topics being covered on the blog, a trend I’m sure will continue throughout 2017. Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>
