I first saw [Betamax](http://betamax.software) a couple of years ago when Rob
Fletcher created it. More recently, I read about it being used with Scala in a
[blog post by Rob Slifka at Sharethrough](http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/07/integration-testing-http-requests-with-scala-and-betamax/),
which got me thinking about how we might tidy up using it in various Scala test
frameworks.

Betamax is originally written in Groovy, but as a JVM language, its compiled classes
can be used with any application written in a JVM language. Its simplest use is in a
[JUnit](http://junit.org/) test, or any test framework that supports features of the
JUnit API, e.g. [Spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/). However, for whatever reason,
JUnit hasn't really gained as much traction in Scala as other test frameworks, with users
often preferring to use [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) or
[specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/).

## JUnit in Scala

Let's take a look at a simple Java example using JUnit first (ruthlessly pinched from the
Betamax homepage):

~~~ java
import co.freeside.betamax.Betamax;
import co.freeside.betamax.Recorder;
import org.junit.*;

public class MyTest {

    @Rule public Recorder recorder = new Recorder();

    @Betamax(tape="my tape")
    @Test
    public void testMethodThatAccessesExternalWebService() {
      // test me
    }
}
~~~

What this is doing is registering a `Recorder` as a JUnit `@Rule` - this is a JUnit
feature that basically registers the instance as an object that's going to interact with
each test, in this case a `MethodRule` that interacts with each test, rather than the
class as a whole. JUnit will call the implemented `MethodRule.apply` method on the rule
object before each test is run. The Betamax recorder then checks the test method that is
about to be run to see whether it has a `@Betamax` annotation, and if so, handles the
test using the specified tape name.

Well that seems pretty simple, doesn't it, so let's try the same thing in a Scala JUnit
test (I'm using the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API) as a simple XML
webservice - you can see the source
[here](http://gist.github.com/6029082#file-WeatherClient-scala)):

~~~ scala
import org.junit.Test
import org.junit.Assert._
import org.junit.Rule
import co.freeside.betamax.Recorder
import co.freeside.betamax.Betamax

class WeatherTest {
  
  @Rule val recorder = new Recorder
  
  @Betamax(tape="junit")
  @Test def findLondon = assertEquals("London, GB", WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location)
  
}
~~~

At first glance, this seems simple enough - we can pack up and go home. Unfortunately,
when we try and run this test we get an error from JUnit saying that an object with a
`@Rule` annotation must be public. Obviously there's something odd about the way Scala
processes annotations on a value (all values are public unless declared otherwise), or
the value itself, that JUnit's reflection can't pick it up. Fortunately, a change was
made in JUnit for this very problem, and we can instead annotate a function that returns
the value:

~~~ scala
val recorder = new Recorder
@Rule def recorderDef = recorder
~~~

JUnit is happy with this, but when we run the test the Betamax recorder still doesn't
get used. It turns out this is because of a
[bug](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/589) with methods annotated with `@Rule`
that return a `MethodRule` - hopefully this will get fixed, and then JUnit + Betamax
should work fine.

## specs2

So now let's look at the library that Rob Slifka was having problems with - specs2. If
you read Rob's [blog post](http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/07/integration-testing-http-requests-with-scala-and-betamax/)
you'll remember that he had a test that is fetching JSON from Twitter:

~~~ scala
".apply" should {
  "fetch and parse JSON from the Twitter endpoint" in {
    val url = "http://www.buzzfeed.com/despicableme2/15-reasons-we-wish-we-were-steve-carell/"
	
    var tw = Twitter(url)
	
    tw.url    must_== url
    tw.tweets must_== 29
  }
}
~~~

To use Betamax around his `var tw = Twitter(url)` he ended up with a helper function:

~~~ scala
def withTape(tapeName:String, functionUnderTest:() => Any) = {
  synchronized {
    val recorder = new Recorder
    val proxyServer = new ProxyServer(recorder)

    recorder.insertTape(tapeName)
    proxyServer.start()

    try {
      functionUnderTest()
    } finally {
      recorder.ejectTape()
      proxyServer.stop()
    }
  }
}
~~~

He could then use the helper in the middle of his test:

~~~ scala
var tw:Twitter = null
BetamaxHelper.withTape("Twitter.apply", () => {
  tw = Twitter(url)
})
~~~

This works fine, but for me it's a bit distracting in the middle of the test to have
the `BetamaxHelper` getting involved. Also, using `null` in Scala is a bit of a code
smell if you ask me, so I thought I'd see if we could do it in a slightly tidier way.

Here's my simple specs2 test:

~~~ scala
import org.specs2.mutable._

class WeatherSpec extends Specification {

  "The Weather Client" should {
    "find London, GB" in {
      WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location must beEqualTo("London, GB")
    }
  }
  
}
~~~

One thing to notice about specs2 tests is that there are no explicit function
definitions, so there's nowhere to put our `@Betamax` annotation - I believe this was
the reason for Rob's findings in the last paragraph of _The Journey_ in his blog. The
reason for there being no function to annotate is because, for the sake of
readability, the tests are just created on construction by having an implicit
function that turns your string into a test fragment and allows you to join it to
other fragments using functions like `should` and `in`. The test fragments are then
filtered and run after the class has been initialised (and your code has been stored
as a partially applied function for execution when needed).

Looking through the specs2 documentation we discover that there's a trait for wrapping around a test specification, `Around`.
We can implement that to do the Betamax jiggery-pokery without interfering with the
readability of the test:

~~~ scala
package specs2

import org.specs2.mutable.Around
import org.specs2.execute.AsResult
import co.freeside.betamax.Recorder
import co.freeside.betamax.proxy.jetty.ProxyServer
import co.freeside.betamax.TapeMode

class Betamax(tape: String, mode: Option[TapeMode] = None) extends Around {
  def around[T: AsResult](t: => T) = Betamax.around(t, tape, mode)
}

object Betamax {
  // syntactic sugar does away with 'new' in tests
  def apply(tape: String, mode: Option[TapeMode] = None) = new Betamax(tape, mode)

  def around[T: AsResult](t: => T, tape: String, mode: Option[TapeMode]) = {
    synchronized {
      val recorder = new Recorder
      val proxyServer = new ProxyServer(recorder)
      recorder.insertTape(tape)
      recorder.getTape.setMode(mode.getOrElse(recorder.getDefaultMode()))
      proxyServer.start()
      try {
        AsResult(t)
      } finally {
        recorder.ejectTape()
        proxyServer.stop()
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

We can then use this in our test spec:

~~~ scala
"The Weather Client" should {
  "find London, GB" in Betamax("weather client") {
    WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location must beEqualTo("London, GB")
  }
}
~~~

I think this looks a bit tidier, and closer to the Betamax examples using annotations.
However, there is one small disadvantage of doing it this way - having the `Around`
implementation in the companion object with the body wrapped in a synchronized
statement means that tests can be run in parallel, but it means that the whole test
runs in parallel rather than just the section of the test that's actually doing the
HTTP request. For me, that's a price worth paying (at least you can still run all your
non-HTTP tests in parallel) in return for more readable tests, but I'll admit it's a
matter of personal preference.

## ScalaTest

Now onto our last test framework. Here's a simple ScalaTest test:

~~~ scala
import org.scalatest.FunSuite

class WeatherSuite extends FunSuite {

  test("weather for london") {
    assert(WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location === "London, GB")
  }

}
~~~

As with specs2, we see that ScalaTest has gone down a similar route of not using
explicit function definitions for defining tests, and instead using the `test`
function to allow a partially applied anonymous function that implements the test
to be stored against a test name string.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any way to hook into the test specification. What I
would have liked is to be able to do something like:

~~~ scala
test("weather for london") with Betamax("tape name") {
  assert(WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location === "London, GB")
}
~~~

I just couldn't work out a way to get this to work - I'd be very happy for someone
to point me in the right direction. Anyway, instead I implemented a `Betamax` trait
that allows me to use a `testWithBetamax` function:

~~~ scala
trait Betamax {

  protected def test(testName: String, testTags: Tag*)(testFun: => Unit)
  
  def testWithBetamax(tape: String, mode: Option[TapeMode] = None)(testName: String, testTags: Tag*)(testFun: => Unit) = {
    test(testName, testTags: _*) {
      val recorder = new Recorder
      val proxyServer = new ProxyServer(recorder)
      recorder.insertTape(tape)
      recorder.getTape.setMode(mode.getOrElse(recorder.getDefaultMode()))
      proxyServer.start()
      try {
        testFun
      } finally {
        recorder.ejectTape()
        proxyServer.stop()
      }
    }
  }

}
~~~

This allows us to use Betamax in our test as follows:

~~~ scala
class WeatherSuite extends FunSuite with Betamax {

  testWithBetamax("scala-test", Some(TapeMode.READ_ONLY))("weather for london") {
    assert(WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location === "London, GB")
  }

}
~~~

## Conclusion

So there we go, using Betamax to record and replay HTTP requests in Scala tests is
definitely possible, and without having to compromise much in the way of test
readability.

# Update

I just couldn't leave the ScalaTest example like that - it just wasn't readable
enough for me. You'll remember that my ideal usage would look like this:

~~~ scala
test("weather for london") with Betamax("tape name") {
  assert(WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location === "London, GB")
}
~~~

The first problem with this is that the `with` keyword is reserved in Scala - it's
how you add extra traits beyond the one that's being extended - so instead let's
use the word `using`.

The next problem is that we need to insert our code between the first and second
parameter list to the `test` method. We can do this using a partially applied
function, by adding `_` after the first parameter list, so our test declaration
now needs to look something like:

~~~ scala
test("weather for london") _ using betamax("tape name") { ... }
~~~

Now the problem we have is that there's no such method as `using` on a function.
We need to transform it into an object that _does_ have a using function - a trait
with an implicit conversion should do the trick:

~~~ scala
trait Wrapped {
  implicit def wrapPartialFunction(f: (=> Unit) => Unit) = new wrapped(f)

  class wrapped(f: (=> Unit) => Unit) {
    def using(f1: => Unit) = f {
      f1
    }
  }
}
~~~

We've now created the ability to insert any extra function we like between the
`test` function's two parameter lists - indeed this trait could be used to add all
sorts of different resources around a ScalaTest suite, and should work equally well
with **Should-In** and **Given-When-Then** ScalaTest language.

All that remains to do now is to implement the `Betamax` trait to allow us to use
the `betamax` "keyword":

~~~ scala
import co.freeside.betamax.TapeMode
import co.freeside.betamax.Recorder
import co.freeside.betamax.proxy.jetty.ProxyServer

trait Betamax extends Wrapped{

  def betamax(tape: String, mode: Option[TapeMode] = None)(testFun: => Unit) = {
    println("Starting Betamax")
    val recorder = new Recorder
    val proxyServer = new ProxyServer(recorder)
    recorder.insertTape(tape)
    recorder.getTape.setMode(mode.getOrElse(recorder.getDefaultMode()))
    proxyServer.start()
    try {
      testFun
    } finally {
      recorder.ejectTape()
      proxyServer.stop()
    }
  }

}
~~~

Simple! And finally, our test looks like:

~~~ scala
import org.scalatest.FunSuite
import co.freeside.betamax.TapeMode

class WeatherSuite extends FunSuite with Betamax {

  test("weather for london using betamax") _ using betamax("scala-test", Some(TapeMode.READ_ONLY)) {
    assert(WeatherClient.weatherFor("london,gb").location === "London, GB")
  }

}
~~~

Ah, that's better. I'm happy now :)

Implicit functions are very useful little things - if you look at the Specs2 source,
you'll find them being used liberally all over the place to turn string test names
into rich test fragments, and so on. In this example you could of course also get
rid of the `Some` from the `TapeMode`, by declaring a function with signature
`implicit def optionalTapeMode(t: TapeMode): Option[TapeMode]`.
