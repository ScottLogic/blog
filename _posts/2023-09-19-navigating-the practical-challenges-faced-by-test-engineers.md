The role of a *Test Engineer* is vital in software development, but it comes with a set of practical problems that demand careful attention and solutions. The ever-tightening project timelines, balancing comprehensive testing, and maintaining accurate testware with continuously evolving requirements are ongoing challenges that we must navigate to ensure the delivery of high-quality software products. 
Along with these, there comes another set of practical issues. Addressing these issues proactively is essential for achieving successful testing outcomes in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

Let's explore these issues one by one, in a bit of detail:

### You Seldom Work In An Ideal Team
In the world of Agile methodologies, the ideal team includes a cross-functional group of individuals working collaboratively to meet end-user requirements effectively. Ideally, this team comprises a product owner, scrum master and a development team with a mix of developers and testers. However, in reality, most teams consist of a development team with a single lead or senior member. The roles of the product owner and scrum master, pivotal in agile, are often understaffed or perceived as less valuable.

The absence of a dedicated product owner can lead to misunderstandings about user behavior, critical features, and misguided efforts. Similarly, without an effective scrum master, essential Scrum ceremonies may become disorganized and less productive.

As *Test Engineers*, we have a significant responsibility of ensuring the overall quality of the application, and the absence of a dedicated product owner and scrum master adds to our responsibilities immensely.

To mitigate this issue, it's crucial for agile teams to ensure continuous collaboration with stakeholders. As *Test Engineers*, we can enable this by building relationships, maintaining a regular feedback loop. Also, to avoid any misinterpretation, it is important to keep necessary documentation updated. Sprint reviews become even more important in such circumstances. In addition to that, it is important that the team is aware and well-informed about the essentials of scrum to be able to utilize it effectively.


### Estimation - Only Test Execution Effort Is Emphasized
Agile emphasizes the earliest start of testing activities because testing involves much more than test execution. Test planning, test design, data preparation, tracking evolving requirements, regression testing, exploratory testing, updating scripts, verification, retesting, and documentation are all essential parts of testing. However, when estimating user stories, these activities are often sidelined, with an emphasis given only on allocating minimal time for test execution. Moreover, a lot of work items are pushed into test last minute accounting only for test execution time.

This can lead to unrealistic time and resource constraints and hence an increased risk of insufficient test coverage. It limits the thorough validation of functionality, potentially allowing critical defects to go unnoticed. In addition, it hinders test automation and regression testing efforts resulting in regressions escaping detection and significant technical debt.

To mitigate this issue, it is important for a *Test Engineer* to work closely with the team during the estimation process and voice the importance of quality assurance. Maybe standardized estimation practices that accurately estimate testing efforts, allocating sufficient time for testing activities. Separate testing tasks/subtasks can be created to improve visibility around various testing activities involved.


### Unavailability Of Dedicated Test Resources
Again, at many places, there is not much emphasis on ensuring the availability of dedicated test resources, especially on relatively small-scale projects.

When testing resources are not dedicated, they often become shared across team/s. This can lead to resource conflicts, where *Test Engineers* must split their time and attention, hindering their ability to focus on testing. They may have to wait for access to test environments, data, or equipment causing delays in testing activities. Delays in testing can ripple through the development cycle, affecting release schedules.

Now, while this issue depends a lot on the project size and budget, it is important for a *Test Engineer* to stress the role of dedicated test environments. Start small and try exploring cost-effective solutions. However, if budget constraints are severe, propose a resource-sharing plan for optimizing resource utilization and streamlining testing processes. It will be helpful in ensuring transparency and clarity regarding who is using what resources and when. This transparency would help team members understand the constraints and plan their activities accordingly. It will foster a sense of shared responsibility, leading to better overall project outcomes.


### We Need To Be Jack Of All Trades But Can Master None
As automation testing becomes essential in quality assurance, *Test Engineers* face the challenge of keeping themselves upskilled accordingly. With numerous tools and technologies available, this can be overwhelming, especially if they lack prior experience in a particular area. Furthermore, a *Test Engineer's* engagement with a specific technology is constrained within the realm of testing. Also, frequent project changes in service-based organizations often mean working with different tools, each bringing a different technology. This limited and varied interaction with technologies on one hand demands understanding of various technologies but makes it difficult to gain necessary experience with a single technology at the same time.

To mitigate this issue, *Test Engineers* must stay aware of the latest industry trends, familiarize themselves with the latest technologies and continuously update their skills. Sparing some time for self-learning once in a while can make a significant difference. In addition, it is important not to restrict yourself to test activities. The Agile environment is perfect to facilitate collaboration and gain a 360-degree understanding of the application and the surrounding technologies, so make sure you utilize it to the fullest.


### We Are Often Stuck Alone
Being the sole *Test Engineer* in a modern Agile Scrum team is very common these days and comes with its own set of feelings and challenges. While it can be rewarding, it can also be demanding and occasionally isolating. With no fellow testers to share the workload or perspectives, the onus of quality assurance could seem to rest solely on your shoulders. The absence of peers in the same role could limit opportunities for mentorship or skill development through collaboration.

Here, active communication, collaboration, and maintaining a cohesive relationship with the development team and other stakeholders become paramount. Maintaining open lines of communication is crucial to address the challenges that arise from working alone.


### We Are The First To Take The Bashing 
As a *Test Engineer*, it's not uncommon to find ourselves on the front lines when something goes awry in production. Our work may go unnoticed when everything runs smoothly; we often become the first point of criticism when a failure occurs. It's often that the *Test engineers* would find themselves in the spotlight, not for praise, but for scrutiny.

To this, my fellow *Test Engineers*, I would like to say - *"let us wear our invisible capes proudly. It's our dedication that ensures the software world keeps turning!"*


To conclude, the role of a *Test Engineer* is multifaceted, and it comes with its share of practical challenges. However, these challenges, when addressed proactively, provide opportunities for growth and improvement. Embracing these challenges and finding effective solutions not only enhances the quality of our work but also contributes to the success of the software development process as a whole.
