Traders and other financial professionals interact with a wide range of systems throughout the course of their day. Working across this cluttered application estate can be a challenge, resulting in workflows that are fractured and inefficient.

Recently, we’ve seen an emerging vision for a more integrated desktop application ecosystem, with various open-source and vendor products – such as OpenFin, Glue42 and Finsemble – providing integration and interoperability.

In this webinar, Colin:
- describes the compelling business benefits of these technologies
- explores key challenges, including the migration of legacy applications
- sets out a pragmatic adoption approach through which your business can be early adopters of the New Normal
