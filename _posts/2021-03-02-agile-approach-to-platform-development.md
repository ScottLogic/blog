The Scottish Government has been on a journey to deliver its payments platform, currently in its Beta phase, drawing on insights from GDS, other governments and public sectors, and market trends, while tailoring the approach to its own context.

It has involved introducing incremental ways of conceiving, planning and delivering services, with new processes to place the user at the heart of the development. It has involved introducing different forms of governance, with more frequent milestones at which pivotal decisions can be made. And it has benefited from building and fostering longer-term partnerships both inside and outside of government.

In this talk, Hugh Wallace, Transformation Lead at the Scottish Government, offers his insights on introducing and sustaining this new, agile approach to platform development. I provide the supplier perspective on this partnership, drawing on Scott Logic’s experience of being delivery partner for the Scottish Government Payment Service.
