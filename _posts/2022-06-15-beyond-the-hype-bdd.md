In this month’s episode we talk about Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), a testing practice where system behaviours are captured in a human readable Domain Specific Language (DSL), which are automated and executed.

Colin is joined by colleagues Daniel McNamee, Xin Chen and Jack Arnstein who bring their many years of testing experience to a lively debate on this topic.

They discuss the essence of BDD: is it the DSL, the automation frameworks, or is it more simply the conversations that take place as part of writing these scenarios / feature files?

There are also limitations to BDD, so they discuss when it provides value, and when it might not. And they consider the question ‘just how expensive is it as an approach?’. Finally they wrap up by considering whether BDD is simply misunderstood.
