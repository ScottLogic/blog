summary: We’ve all played a game with Box2D physics (e.g. Angry Birds). Google forked
  Box2D to add fluid simulation, but diverged irretrievably in the process. In this
  talk, I ask whether we can salvage Google’s contributions and bring both these C++
  projects to the modern web using WebAssembly and TypeScript?
