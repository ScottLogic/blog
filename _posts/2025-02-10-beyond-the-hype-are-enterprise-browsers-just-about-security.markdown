In this episode of Beyond the Hype, I'm joined by Bradon Rogers from Island, along with Scott Logic colleagues Dean Kerr and Robat Williams, to explore the potential of enterprise browsers.

We delve into the advantages of enterprise browsers over standard options like Chrome and Edge, particularly in terms of security and productivity. Bradon describes how enterprise browsers, built on a Chromium foundation, offer a familiar user experience while integrating robust security features and application delivery capabilities.

We cover the challenges of using consumer-grade browsers in corporate environments, the benefits of desktop container technologies, and the potential for enterprise browsers to simplify security and enhance user productivity. Join us as we consider whether enterprise browsers will transform the way organisations manage and secure their digital workspaces.
