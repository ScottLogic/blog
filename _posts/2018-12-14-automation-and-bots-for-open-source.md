Colin Eberhardt's talk from the Open Source Strategy Forum 2018

When developing software we typically work with our friends, peers and colleagues, in small close-knit teams where we share a common goal. With open source projects, we often work with strangers, people we may never speak to, let alone meet. Creating a quality product, with such a disparate team can be quite a challenge. This talk takes a look at how tools and automation are a critical component when creating a successful open source project. Tooling can be used to enforce code standards, testing, licensing and other legal requirements, and much more. In this talk we’ll look at some of the tools that are available to you – and how to build your own!
