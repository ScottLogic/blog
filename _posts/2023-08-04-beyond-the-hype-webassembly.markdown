summary: In this episode, I'm joined by Bailey Hayes from Cosmonic and Sean Isom from
  Adobe to go beyond the hype with WebAssembly. We start by discussing the early days
  of WebAssembly, and where it all began, in the browser. We debate the infamous tweet
  that compares WebAssembly to Docker, and look at the future promise of the Component
  Model, which aims to break down language barriers.

In this episode, I'm joined by Bailey Hayes from Cosmonic and Sean Isom from Adobe – between them, they have a wealth of WebAssembly experience and insights.

We start by discussing the early days of WebAssembly, and where it all began, in the browser. We debate the infamous tweet that compares WebAssembly to Docker, and look at the future promise of the Component Model, which aims to break down language barriers.

Given the amount of activity happening in the WebAssembly/WASI/Component Model space, there are a few upcoming events you might be interested in:
