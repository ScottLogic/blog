In Scott Logic we have an active group of big data enthusiasts. We also have a good number of passionate chess players.
Thanks to these colleague I was made aware of the existence of [the lichess games database.](https://database.lichess.org/)
It is a (at the time of writing) a collection of more than 202,000,000 chess games available to anyone for free!
The data from 2017 alone, after unpacking was over 100GB. [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a perfect
technology for making this immense data set easier to explore. In this blog post I will show how this data
set can be reduced to the size that makes it explorable with Excel and show some interesting chess statistic that
can be mined from it. If you are really impatient, you can [checkout the code](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner) and download the
[Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner/raw/master/consolidatedOpeningFiles/2017-consolidatedOpeningFile.xlsx) right now!

## First look at Lichess data set

[Lichess](https://lichess.org/) is an open source website where people of all skills can play chess together. As mentioned
earlier, they also make [all their games data]((https://database.lichess.org/)) accessible for everyone. This data
comes in the PGN (Portable Game Notation) format and contains information about the players, the game conditions (time,
event etc.) and the game moves. It looks like that:

You can see vast amount of information here, but no easy way of querying it or filtering.

## First look at Apache Spark

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/apache-spark-logo.png" />

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is technology targeted at quick processing of large amounts of data. When faced
with more than 100GB this is exactly what is needed. You can find details of the installation on their website.
Since I am Mac user with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) all I had to do to install it is to run:

~~~
brew install apache-spark
~~~

after that I can run Spark shell with simple:

~~~
spark-shell
~~~

Installation was simple enough, the next step is actually being able to parse one of the data sets. I started by making a small Java program,
where all that was needed in the maven file was:

~~~xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
            <artifactId>spark-sql_2.11</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
~~~

The first attempted analysis was just counting the white wins, black wins and draws:

~~~java
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf;
import org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset;
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;

public class ChessSparkMiner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String pngFile = "/Users/bartoszjedrzejewski/github/chesssparkminer/lichess_db_standard_rated_2013-01.pgn"; // Should be some file on your system
        SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()
                .appName("Chess Spark Miner")
                .config(new SparkConf().setMaster("local[2]")) //need to connect to localy running Spark
                .getOrCreate();
        Dataset<String> logData = spark.read().textFile(pngFile).cache();
        long whiteWin = logData.filter(s -> s.contains("1-0")).count();
        long blackWin = logData.filter(s -> s.contains("0-1")).count();
        long draw = logData.filter(s -> s.contains("1/2-1/2")).count();
        System.out.println("White wins: " + whiteWin);
        System.out.println("Black wins: " + blackWin);
        System.out.println("Draw: " + draw);
        spark.stop();
    }
}
~~~

This does not work very well, as the actual result appears at the end of the game, in the metadata and can
appear in other places (for example usernames). The main issue here is that Spark by default splits by line. This is
not what we want and it can be easily fixed by splitting on some other distinct part of the file. I chose the `"[Event"`
which starts the metadata. Code for doing that smarter split is as follows:

~~~java
        SparkConf conf = new SparkConf()
                .setAppName("Chess Spark Miner")
                .setMaster("local[2]");

        JavaSparkContext sc = new JavaSparkContext(conf);
        sc.setLogLevel("INFO");
        sc.hadoopConfiguration().set("textinputformat.record.delimiter", "[Event");
        JavaRDD<String> pgnData = sc.textFile(filePath);
~~~

With this out of the way, we are ready to start looking at this dataset seriously!

## Processing Lichess Dataset with Apache Spark

My first approach was to try to get the interesting data from that dataset directly with Spark. This resulted in
some complicated code that would take some minutes to run on a massive dataset producing results that I could
not do much more with. Example of that is trying to rank chess opening by their performance at different level
of play. You can see the code written for that in [this commit](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner/commit/a84e6b91da482c589892edf22f8e604b9bcd9e06)
What I am doing there essentially is splitting the dataset:

~~~java
JavaRDD<String> ultraBullet = pgnData.filter(a -> getSpeedMode(a).equals("UltraBullet"));
JavaRDD<String> bullet = pgnData.filter(a -> getSpeedMode(a).equals("Bullet"));
JavaRDD<String> blitz = pgnData.filter(a -> getSpeedMode(a).equals("Blitz"));
JavaRDD<String> classical = pgnData.filter(a -> getSpeedMode(a).equals("Classical"));
~~~

followed by:

~~~java
JavaPairRDD<String, ScoreCount> openingToGameScore = pgnData //take some of the already filtered data
.mapToPair(game -> new Tuple2<>(getOpening(game), new ScoreCount(getScore(game), 1))) //map each game to opening and extracted score
.reduceByKey((score1, score2) -> score1.add(score2)); //reduce the dataset by merging scores
~~~

This worked ok, but was inflexible. However, it gave me idea on how to work successfully with a dataset like this. I was
interested in specific categories here (namely the speed of play in the games), but there were other categories that
I would like to mix and match. If I could reduce the data to about 200,000 rows/categories then I could do the rest of the
investigation from Excel. This idea is partially inspired by [OLAP cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) and
my great admiration for Excel Pivot Table functionality.

The approach I took was to create a `GameKey` out of every game that would contain:

~~~java
    private final String opening; //the opening being played
    private final String eco; //the eco code of the opening
    private final String tempo; //speed of the game - blitz, bullet, standard
    private final String avgEloClass; //average level of players as a category
    private final String ratingDiffClass; //difference between white and black player as a category
~~~

Using that key I have with 365,009 categories- a number that you can deal with in Excel Pivot table. Each of these
categories is being described by a `ScoreCount` object that contains:

~~~java
    private final double score; //total amount of points from this category (for white)
    private final double count; //total number of games
    private final double drawCount; //number of draws
    private final double whiteWinCount; //number of white wins
    private final double blackWinCount; //number of white wins
    private final double sumWhiteElo; //sum of white player rankings (can get average by dividing by count)
    private final double sumBlackElo; //sum of black player rankings (can get average by dividing by count)
~~~

This gives the first few rows of the data as follows:

~~~
opening|eco|tempo|avgEloClass|ratingDiffClass|averageScore|score|count|drawCount|whiteWinCount|blackWinCount|averageWhiteElo|averageBlackElo|sumWhiteElo|sumBlackElo
?|A02|Bullet|1600-1799|White+200|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1763.0|1660.0|1763.0|1660.0
King's Pawn Opening: 2.b3|C20|Blitz|1400-1599|Black+200|0.2915287888815354|440.5|1511.0|41.0|420.0|1050.0|1418.5949702183984|1590.5771012574453|2143497.0|2403362.0
Gruenfeld Defense: Exchange Variation, Spassky Variation|D87|Classical|2400+|White=Black|0.5|0.5|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|2465.0|2435.0|2465.0|2435.0
Sicilian Defense: Boleslavsky Variation|B58|Bullet|1600-1799|White+200|0.6|3.0|5.0|0.0|3.0|2.0|1756.0|1602.4|8780.0|8012.0
~~~

Format that can be read as a delimited file by Excel and analysed in depth!

##Final words on Spark

Using spark to process the data and prepare the [resulting dataset](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner/raw/master/consolidatedOpeningFiles/2017-consolidatedOpeningFile.xlsx)
was very interesting experience. Once you get familiar with the map-reduce style of Spark it feels very natural. I think
it is a suitable tool to transform your data and make it ready for analysis by less efficient, but more user friendly tools.
I was surprised by the speed and performance of the Spark itself. I never really had to worry that I am dealing with
tens of gigabytes of data- it just worked flawlessly. The final code that I used to prepare that dataset can be
downloaded from my [github repository](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner/). I used the
'processPGNFile' method to process the raw data and 'consolidateOpeningFiles' to connect the multiple outputs and turn
it into one master spreadsheet.

##Chess Insights

This part is especially for fellow chess players who are interested in the actual data and findings. I am not aware of a similar
scale analysis of online blitz data, so hopefully you will find something new and interesting for yourself here!

###How reliable is the rating system?

The first question I was interested in investigating was if the rating system works equally well for low and high rated players?
In principle 1400 vs 1200 should score just as well as 2200 vs 2000, but I was always unsure if this was indeed the case.
To find out answer to that question I have plotted results from different uneven encounters against overall rating average of
both players:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-rating.PNG" />

Based on 36,000,000+ games used for this analysis- it works very well!

###Which openings are the most popular?

The other obvious question is- what are the popular openings out there? Are players rated ~1400 play the same
systems as the 2400+ rated crowd? Obviously not. The analysis here will be about the most popular variation, not really
opening as a whole (Sicilian Defense is not counted as one, but as many different separate Sicilian Defense variants).
Looking at analysis with regards to specific groups of opening would be another interesting way to look at this data.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-most-popular-overall.PNG" />

Looking at this data it is quickly obvious that Scandinavian Defense is not as popular on higher level of plays
as it is among amateur players. Most of these openings lose popularity as ratings increase. Let's have a look at what
the really strong players are choosing:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-most-popular-2400.PNG" />

Here Modern Defense and Hungarian Opening are dominating the table. It seems that on the higher end of the blitz levels
people prefer less theoretical openings. If we filter for only slower games:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-most-popular-2400-slow.PNG" />

We can see more familiar and theoretical openings at the top of the 2400+ players preferences.

###Look at openings performance

One thing that excites many chess players are debates- which openings are the best, what should be played etc. Here
I want to investigate performance for responses against e4 different than e5. The openings I chose to look
at are:

* Alekhine Defense
* French Defense
* Sicilian Defense
* Caro Kann
* Modern Defense

As I am a Sicilian Defense player, I know which opening I am rooting for! I will compare these results to what is
expected on average from black. I created two separate charts- one for blitz and one for classical, as there are significant
differences with how these opening fare at different speeds. I also did not have enough (100's not 1000's) of 2400+ classical
games in the data set to make the analysis good enough:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-opening-blitz.PNG" />

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-opening-classical.PNG" />

The lower on the chart, the stronger the better the opening does for black... And it seems that Alekhine Defense is an
excellent choice, especially in classical games! As somewhat expected, Sicilian Defense does very well being the most
popular of these choices among all chess players.

And since I work in Scott Logic and King's Gambit is an ever popular opening among many players here I have to provide
some statistics on that as well!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/bjedrzejewski/assets/spark-chess-kings-gambit.PNG" />

It is a solid opening up to 2000 level, with not enough data above 2400 to make a decent analysis. It is definitely
a joy to play!

##Conclusion and what is next

I really enjoyed using Apache Spark and working with the amazing lichess dataset. I feel that I have only scratched the
surface of what exciting facts can be mined from that dataset. I encourage you to [download the spreadsheet](https://github.com/bjedrzejewski/chess-spark-miner/raw/master/consolidatedOpeningFiles/2017-consolidatedOpeningFile.xlsx)
yourself and share your insights and findings!

On the purely technical side- I have only focused on the metadata and did not make use of over 2,000,000 games in that
dataset with computer analysis attached, or even more games with the move time information. Which are the slowest openings to
play? Which ones produce most blunders? A colleague of mine started looking into most common blunders in King's Gambit
to search for possible traps! If you have an idea what else can be mined from this data set, or even better- you did some
research, please share with us in the comments, or let me know on twitter! Good luck in your Data Engineering and Chess!
