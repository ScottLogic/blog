One of the most appealing features of web development is its immediacy; browsers are able to interpret JavaScript, HTML and CSS without the need for a compiler, and as a result development cycles are very rapid - edit, save, reload. Unfortunately with the growing complexity of web applications, this immediacy is something that is all too often lost. Single Page Applications now have complex builds, involving transpilers  dependency resolution, code quality analysis, unit tests and much more. The complexity and execution time of these builds rival their desktop counterparts!

In this talk I'll review how the functional programming style of frameworks such as React, ImmutableJS and Redux have paved the way for novel techniques that once again support rapid  development cycles. With a demonstrations of ‘Hot Module Reload’ and ‘Time Travel’, in the context of complex trading platforms, I’ll show how HTML5 productivity has been taken to new heights that equally benefit web, desktop and mobile development.
