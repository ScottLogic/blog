It's inevitable that failures happen. Although trying to prevent possible failures to a system is certainly worthwhile, we can also embrace failures and learn how to adapt.

In this talk, I explore some of the foundations and common approaches for designing resilient systems in cloud environments. I also look into how experimenting with our systems, by deliberately introducing failures, can help us better understand their behaviour.

This talk is intended for anyone in a technology role, such as technology leaders, developers, architects and testers.
