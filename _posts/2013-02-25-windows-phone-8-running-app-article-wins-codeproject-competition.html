<p>I've just received an email from those nice folks at CodeProject letting me know that my article <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/521530/A-Windows-Phone-8-Run-Tracking-App-in-100-Lines-of">A Windows Phone 8 Run Tracking App in 100 Lines of Code</a> has just won the <em>Best Mobile article of January 2013</em> award. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/521530/A-Windows-Phone-8-Run-Tracking-App-in-100-Lines-of"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2013/02/WP8RunnerScreenshot.png" alt="WP8RunnerScreenshot" width="500" height="405" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2369" /></a></p>
<p>I must admit, this one was a bit of a surprise. I put this article together very quickly for the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/27839.windows-phone-windows-phone-8-wiki-competition-2012q4.aspx">Nokia Wiki Competition</a>  ... which I didn't win. The article is quite brief, and the app that it described is very simple - this is in contrast to my usual articles on CodeProject, which are often quite lengthy. Judging from the comments, it looks like people really like these short, but focused articles. I might do a few more of these in future! (they are certainly less effort :-P )</p>
