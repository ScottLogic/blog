<p>Welcome to my blog, <em>Colin Eberhardt's Adventures in WPF</em>. This page gives a little background on myself and the blog.</p>
<p>My name is Colin Eberhardt and I have been involved in software, in a number of shapes and forms, for more than a decade now. I have dabbled in a range of technologies from Enterprise Java, C#.NET through to programming embedded DSP and microprocessors. I also have experience in Mechanical, Electronic and Optical engineering; these have helped shape my perspective on software and how it should be developed. I currently work as a Lead Developer at <a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/">Scott Logic</a>, a UK based provider of software and consulting services to the Financial Sector.</p>
<p>This blog is primarily focussed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">Windows Presentation Foundation</a> (WPF), the next-generation UI framework from Microsoft. The reason I started this blog is because the architecture of WPF has a certain beauty to it, however it lacks the drag-and-drop style development tools available to Windows Forms developers, which can make it something of a challenge.</p>
<p>I intend to use this blog to share my ideas, thoughts, tips and tricks with the WPF developer community.</p>
<p>I am happy to receive any questions or feedback.</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>
