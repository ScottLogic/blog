summary: How Scott Logic consultants worked with Rabobank's London IT department to
  improve DevOps practices.
---

Just ahead of the second annual Fin:Code conference in London this week, it’s great to have a client story to announce!
 
Rabobank’s London IT department had adopted DevOps last year, and while general momentum was good, there were inconsistencies between the delivery teams that management wanted to qualify and improve upon. As a consultancy used to delivering complex, mission critical, high quality software to financial services organisations, Rabobank felt Scott Logic was the ideal partner to coach the teams.
 
Over 3 months, Scott Logic consultants worked with the team to identify gaps in DevOps practices and enabled them to create a backlog of improvements. Quick wins were identified and acted upon instantly, as well as longer term plans put in place. 
 
The objectivity and neutrality of the Scott Logic team encouraged constructive dialogue in all teams, and the management team saw a notable improvement to the speed and efficiency of software delivery that DevOps promotes.
