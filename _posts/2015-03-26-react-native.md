A few months ago Facebook announced React Native, a framework that lets you build native iOS applications with JavaScript – and the official repository just came out of beta today!

I was lucky enough to have access to React Native through the beta period, so have spent the last few months playing with the framework and building a simple React Native app. I've written up my experiences as a [tutorial on Ray Wenderlich's website](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript).
