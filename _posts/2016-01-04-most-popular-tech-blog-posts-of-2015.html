<p>The <a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/" target="_blank">Scott Logic tech blog</a> started life in 2008 when I migrated a handful of blog posts from my WordPress site over to the main company website. From these humble beginnings the blog has gone from strength to strength, with the number of visitors to the blog rising each year:</p>

<p>2015 was a busy year on the Scott Logic blog, with 68 posts published by 28 different authors, on a broad range of software development topics. The Scott Logic blog is open to any employee who want to share their thoughts, views and learnings with others.</p>
<p>There aren’t enough hours in the day to try out every new and interesting technology, and for that reason I love to read about other people's experiences. Furthermore, blog posts are great source of information if you find yourself with a tricky problem, you’re rarely the first person to have encountered a particular problem. On a number of occasions I have ‘googled’ a problem only to find the solution was to be found on our own blog!</p>
<p>Looking back on 2015 the five most popular blog posts, in alphabetical order, are as follows (with visit counts suitably corrected based on the date they were published).</p>

<p>I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to everyone who has contributed to our blog in 2015 and look forward to learning more from my colleagues throughout 2016.</p>
