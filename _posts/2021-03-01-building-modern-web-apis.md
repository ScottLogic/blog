summary: In this talk, I explore a little of the history of the term API and covers
  what he considers to be the three most current use cases. I talk about REST and
  GraphQL with a look at the evolving standards in the 'API over the internet' space.
  I also look at how the popularity of Event Sourcing has led to a rise in the number
  of Asynchronous APIs and how standards are emerging in this area too. Finally, I
  round off with my predictions for the future of Web APIs and signposts some of the
  technology which is shaping that future.
