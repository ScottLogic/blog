In this episode, I'm joined by Jess McEvoy and Peter Chamberlin, who have both spent many years in senior roles within public sector organisations.

Our conversation covers the excitement and concerns around AI, both from a citizen's perspective and for those building public services. We discuss the UK government’s approach to addressing AI challenges with its pro-innovation mantra, and whether this creates the right environment for success. We also touch on the need for global cooperation when tackling what are increasingly becoming global challenges.
