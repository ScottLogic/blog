### Approaching design and delivery in small batches
Delivering software is hard, there’s no doubt about it. And that fact is often, if not always, underestimated. Even setting aside internal or external dependencies, legacy or technology constraints, known unknowns – or the infamous unknown unknowns – it’s often made exponentially harder by teams with good intentions trying to design the perfect solution long before a single line of code is written. In this paper, we look at how to address this paradox, exploring the benefits of starting small to ultimately build big; why this is difficult to do in practice, how to identify opportunities to break down bigger problems, and practical approaches to avoid failure.
