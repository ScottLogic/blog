summary: In this episode – the second of a two-parter – we talk to Denis Mandich,
  CTO of Qrypt, about the growing threat that Quantum Computers will ultimately render
  our current cryptographic techniques useless – an event dubbed ‘Y2Q’, in a nod to
  the Y2K issue we faced over twenty years ago.

In this episode – the second of a two-parter – Oliver Cronk and I talk to Denis Mandich, CTO of Qrypt, a company that creates quantum-secure encryption products.

Our conversation covers the perils of bad random number generation, which undermines our security protocols, and the growing threat that Quantum Computers will ultimately render our current cryptographic techniques useless – an event dubbed ‘Y2Q’, in a nod to the Y2K issue we faced over twenty years ago.
