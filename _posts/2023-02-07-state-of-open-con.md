The rapid rise in the consumption or usage of open source hasn’t been met with an equal rise in contribution – to put it simply, there are far more takers than givers, and the challenges created by this imbalance are starting to emerge.

Most industries turn to open source for innovation and collaboration, however, the public sector instead looks for transparency and productivity. Public sector organisations have well-intentioned open source software policies, but they fail to embrace the broad potential value of open source.

In this talk we’ll take a data-driven approach to highlight the needs of public sector organisations and explore potential opportunities. Finally, we’ll look at how this sector might be the key to solving OSS’ sustainability challenges for the long term.
