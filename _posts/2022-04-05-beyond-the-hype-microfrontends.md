summary: A relatively new architectural style for building web-based applications,
  micro-frontends are an extension of the popular microservices pattern where the
  vertical slice of functionality that a microservice provides is extended all the
  way to the front-end. With micro-frontends, you can more easily scale your development
  teams by composing applications from loosely coupled frontend components. In this
  podcast we ask the question 'Do you actually need a micro-frontend?'

A relatively new architectural style for building web-based applications, micro-frontends are an extension of the popular microservices pattern where the vertical slice of functionality that a microservice provides is extended all the way to the front-end. With micro-frontends, you can more easily scale your development teams by composing applications from loosely coupled frontend components.

In this month’s episode, Colin is joined by Dean Kerr (Lead Developer, Scott Logic) and Sam Hogarth (Senior Software Engineer, Tesco Bank) to compare thoughts and experiences gained from many years of front-end development.
