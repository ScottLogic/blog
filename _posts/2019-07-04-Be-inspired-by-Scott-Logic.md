Scott Logic is proud to have been identified as one of **1000 Companies to Inspire Britain** in 2019 by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

We are one of the 28 companies based in the north east of England to be in the top 1000 UK companies with the highest growth – contributing to average turnover growth in the region of 95% from 2016–19.

Since 2014, the LSEG has [published this annual report](https://www.lseg.com/resources/1000-companies-inspire/2019-report-1000-companies-uk) to identify the **UK’s fastest-growing SMEs** and high-growth companies. UK-registered companies with revenues between £6m–£250m are eligible. They are judged on their financial performance – each company’s average annual turnover growth rate is calculated over a three-year period, with the ranking weighted to favour latest-year growth.

In Financial Year 2018, Scott Logic’s **revenues grew by 33%** to £28.5 million and our consultant **workforce grew by 40%**, building on our previous company growth to justify our position in LSEG’s prestigious report.

Through the fruits of our continued success, we are investing in our people, our business and the future of talented young people in a way that we believe is indeed truly inspiring. 

## Investing in our people

As we expand our service offering to our clients, we are **creating new jobs** at each of our four UK offices – in Newcastle, Edinburgh, Bristol and London – aiming to hire new cohorts of experienced consultants in each office along with talented graduates. Each graduate will benefit from our packed induction programme, from mentorship, and from the opportunity to learn on the job, gaining industry insight while working on challenging projects using a diverse range of technologies.

## Investing in our business

And we are not just growing our business in the UK. With our long heritage of delivering innovative solutions with our Scandinavian clients, we **opened our Copenhagen office** in June 2019, creating the hub from which we will provide our knowledge and expertise to mainland Northern Europe.

## Investing in the future

Having founded our business in the north east of England, we are acutely aware of the challenges facing people in some of the UK’s most deprived areas, particularly in relation to social mobility. That’s why we are supporting the futures of **young people with untapped potential** from deprived backgrounds – we have invested in the set-up of the [Altitude Foundation](https://altitudefoundation.org/), a new charity that enables them to pursue their passion for technology, get their first job and inspire others to do the same.

Our growth has been driven by the quality of the service we provide to our clients in helping them build the solutions they need. And the quality of our service is defined by our people, who live our company values of excellence, passion, collaboration, professionalism and respect.
