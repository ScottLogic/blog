summary: A working example of how to create a new plugin for Perspective, using a
  ready made template to get started quickly, and open source mapping API from OpenLayers.
---

JP Morgan's [Perspective](https://jpmorganchase.github.io/perspective/){:target="_blank"} is an open source streaming analytics engine that uses WebAssembly to quickly analyse a dataset and display views via a plugin framework.

In [Building a Perspective plugin with d3fc](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/04/18/building-a-perspective-plugin-with-d3fc.html), I looked at how we used d3fc to render a generic graph view. In this post, I want to take a closer look at the Plugin API.

For this example I wanted something a bit different than the usual charts and grids, but with some visual appeal, so I have gone for a mapping plugin based on [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/){:target="_blank"} and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/51.1366/-3.6823){:target="_blank"}.

Here is a working example that you can interact with: [Perspective Maps Example](https://bl.ocks.org/DevAndyLee/0efd87f7c0b8725a1c6bef8eafe86103){:target="_blank"}. Try dragging the `region` variable into "Split By" or "Filter" to see how you can manipulate the view.

The completed project is on GitHub: [perspective-viewer-maps](https://github.com/DevAndyLee/perspective-viewer-maps){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting Started

Creating a new plugin project is really easy. I have created a starter template for this purpose: [perspective-viewer-template](https://github.com/DevAndyLee/perspective-viewer-template){:target="_blank"}. I should note that this is my own template, not an official Perspective one, though hopefully sometime soon there will be an official option to get started with.

### Copy it into a new project

Simply clone or copy the template into a new project (with a different name), and update the name in `package.json`. I called my example "perspective-viewer-maps".

### Run it

Install the dependencies and run it:

{% highlight js %}
npm install
npm start
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! The template comes with a default view that renders to a table:

![initial-table-view.png]({{site.baseurl}}/alee/assets/initial-table-view.png)

### About the template

The default view is in `/src/js/views/view-1.js`. New views should be added to the list in `/src/js/views/views.js`.

A view is a function that takes `container`, `config` and `settings` parameters:

{% highlight js %}
function myView(container, config, settings) {
  // Render view of config into container
  // Use settings object for persisting user settings
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Geographic data

Next, I added a dataset to the included `examples` folder (Met Office sites with latitude/longitude), and updated `index.html` to show the new data.

{% highlight js %}
window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', function () {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', 'metSites.json', true);
  xhr.onload = function () {
    var el = document.getElementsByTagName('perspective-viewer')[0];
    el.load(perspective.worker().table(JSON.parse(xhr.response)));
  }
  xhr.send(null);
});
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<perspective-viewer class="example" view="d3_xy_scatter" columns='["longitude","latitude"]'
        aggregates='{"latitude":"avg","longitude":"avg"}'>
</perspective-viewer>
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the `latitude`/`longitude` aggregates use `avg` rather than `sum`, since adding them together makes no sense. An average will give us the average position when grouping.

![initial-xy-map.png]({{site.baseurl}}/alee/assets/initial-xy-map.png)

This view uses the included X/Y Scatter chart to show that we've loaded the data correctly.

## Map view

So let's show an actual map.

### Configure the plugin's view

Rename the template's default view ("view-1") to "map-view", and give it some default parameters so that the user is prompted for "Longitude" and "Latitude":

{% highlight js %}
// views.js
import mapView from "./map-view";
const views = [mapView];
export default views;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
// map-view.js (renamed from view-1.js)
function mapView(container, config, settings) {
    // Render the view of this data
    // â€¦
}
mapView.plugin = {
    type: "map_view",
    name: "Map",
    max_size: 25000,
    initial: {
        type: "number",
        count: 2,
        names: ["Longitude", "Latitude"]
    }
};
export default mapView;
{% endhighlight %}

### Add OpenLayers with OpenStreetMap

Add OpenLayers to the project (`npm install ol`), and update the view function to render a simple map into the container:

{% highlight js %}
import {Map, View} from "ol";
import TileLayer from "ol/layer/Tile";
import OSM from "ol/source/OSM";
import {fromLonLat} from "ol/proj";

function mapView(container, config, settings) {
    // Render the view of this data
    new Map({
        target: container,
        layers: [new TileLayer({source: new OSM()})],
        view: new View({center: fromLonLat([-4.02, 53.43]), zoom: 6.5})
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Bundle the CSS for OpenLayers

Perspective uses custom elements with shadow-DOM, which means that any CSS loaded at the document level will not apply to the plugin. However, we can bundle OpenLayers' css with the plugin's css by adding this line to the less file (`plugin.less`):

{% highlight js %}
@import (inline) "../../node_modules/ol/ol.css";
{% endhighlight %}

![initial-os-map.png]({{site.baseurl}}/alee/assets/initial-os-map.png)

### Plot the data

We need to turn the data from Perspective into a list of points. I've omitted the implementation of [`getMapData()`](https://github.com/DevAndyLee/perspective-viewer-maps/blob/master/src/js/views/map-view.js#L77){:target="_blank"} from this example for brevity, and also because it's going to change quite a lot later (when we start dealing with group-by and split-by options). For now it'll be enough to take each row of the data, get the `longitude` and `latitude` values from it, and turn it into a "feature".

{% highlight js %}
// Render the view of this data
const data = getMapData(config.data);

const vectorSource = new VectorSource({
    features: data.map(point => new Feature(new Circle(fromLonLat(point), 5000)))
});
{% endhighlight %}

![map-with-points.png]({{site.baseurl}}/alee/assets/map-with-points.png)

## Housekeeping

At this point we need to take a step back and sort out a few things I've skipped over. I'll try to be brief as the full implementation is available in the [`source`](https://github.com/DevAndyLee/perspective-viewer-maps/blob/master/src/js/views/map-view.js){:target="_blank"}.

### Deal with grouped and split data

When the user drags a variable into the "Group By" box, Perspective will give us rows with a `__ROW_PATH__` array (with a value for each group variable), and additional rows for the totals. For this plugin we're not using the totals, so we filter out any row where `__ROW_PATH__.length` is less than the number of group variables (`config.row_pivot.length`).

When the user drags a variable into the "Split By" box, Perspective gives us rows where the values use a combined key of the split-by variables and the aggregate. e.g. if I use "region", I'd see values like "sw\|latitude" for the latitude value of the "sw" split, and "sw\|longitude" etc... We'll process these values and give each point a "category" label that we'll use later to colour the points.

See the completed [`getMapData()`](https://github.com/DevAndyLee/perspective-viewer-maps/blob/master/src/js/views/map-view.js#L77){:target="_blank"} function for full details.

### Re-use the map object

At the moment it's clearing the display and rendering a new map each time, so we need to re-arrange the code a little so that we can store the `Map` and `VectorLayer` as private data associated with the DOM node. We can then re-use them when the view is updated, and re-populate the `VectorLayer` with the new points.

### Work out the initial view extents

My first example used a hard-coded location to show the whole of the UK. That works for my sample data, but wouldn't be much use for anywhere else. We need a function that enumerates through the data to get minimum and maximum longitude and latitude. When we initialise the map view the first time, we can set the `center` and `resolution` to give us a suitable initial viewing area.

## Extra features

Here are a few more features that I have added, and some things that I intend to continue to work on.

### Colour based on "Split By" categories

When the user has picked a "Split By" value, we want to colour the points on the map based on which split / category they fall into.

I added an array of category colour values to the code. When there is a category available, we associate each category with one of the colours, and use that colour to style the circle on the map.

### Size based on a third aggregate value

I've added a third (optional) variable to the plugin's configuration to specify size:

{% highlight js %}
mapView.plugin = {
    type: "map_view",
    name: "Map",
    max_size: 25000,
    initial: {
        type: "number",
        count: 2,
        names: ["Longitude", "Latitude", "Size"]
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

When creating features for the map, we can use the "Size" value to set the feature's size. We'll need to enumerate the data to work out the minimum and maximum sizes, and also use a suitable default size as a fallback.

### Tooltips and Click events

On a `mouseover` event, we just need to find the closest point and show a tooltip div with the associated data.

A click event is similar, but we need to send the associated data up to the hosting application to let it know what was clicked. We can do this using a custom event:

{% highlight js %}
container.dispatchEvent(
    new CustomEvent("perspective-click", {
        bubbles: true, composed: true,
        detail: {
            column_names,
            config: {filters},
            row
        }
    })
);
{% endhighlight %}

In the event details:

- `column_names` refers to the aggregate columns selected. In this case it's all of them since you can't click data that represents "Longitude" but not "Latitude" or "Size".

- `filters` should be the list of filters that would need to be applied to another `perspective-viewer` to filter it to this data. i.e. it is the current filter combined with a filter representing the point that was clicked.

- `row` is the original source row given to us by `perspective-viewer`.

### A note about bundling

When I first tried to publish a working example of this project in [Gist](https://gist.github.com)/[Blocks](https://bl.ocks.org), I couldn't get the map tiles to load. It would give CORS errors, and lots of things I tried to solve that problem didn't help. I eventually discovered that it works if the OpenLayers JavaScript is loaded separately, instead of bundled with the project, so that's what the final version does. I'm not sure why, since it seems like it *should* work when bundled, but I didn't get to the bottom of that problem (and it isn't really related to the purpose of this article).

## Conclusion

Creating a new plugin for Perspective really is quick and easy. Most of my time on this project was spent trying to figure out the CORS problem with OpenLayers! The core build took very little time.

Perspective gives us a powerful platform for manipulating all sorts of data ready to display, and the plugin system means that anyone can create their own view. I'm sure there are many different ways to display data than the traditional chart and grid views.
