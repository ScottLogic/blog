summary: Creating omni-channel experiences in enterprise is more often than not a
  challenge in terms of strategy and mindset rather than technology. This white paper
  outlines a twinned design and technical approach that ensures focus is squarely
  on users and the contexts within they use a system.

The rapid pace of smartphone adoption is revolutionising the way in which businesses operate.  From a technology perspective this has resulted in something of a frenzy, with most enterprise organisations in a permanent state of catch-up.  New platforms have been tackled with an approach somewhat akin to a game of Whac-A-Mole, where every feature of every system is delivered on every new platform as and when it pops up; all but ignoring the significant challenge the proliferation of platforms (and devices!) poses for IT departments.

To make matters worse, customers increasingly expect an omni-channel system, where they can use all channels available to them – desktop, smartphone, tablet, smartwatch, .., – as part of a seamless experience.  The current gap between these expectations and business capabilities presents a competitive opportunity for companies that can halt the technology chase and take a more strategic approach, placing an emphasis on user experience.

[Colin Eberhardt]({{site.baseurl}}/ceberhardt) and I have written a [white paper]({{site.baseurl}}/ceberhardt/assets/white-papers/building-omnichannel-systems.pdf) outlining our thoughts and recommendations on how to achieve this both in terms of design and technology, tailored towards a business area we think it is particular pertinent: Capital Markets.  The overarching theme of our argument is that technology should play a supporting role to users' tasks and contexts.  Technology is at its very best not when it wows, or amazes, but when it becomes so natural that it disappears: it just works.
