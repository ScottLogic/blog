In this month's episode, Simon Martin, Chris Price and Rob Pilling share their interest and insights into Rust. This relatively new programming language has caught the attention of the development community, being voted the ‘most-loved’ language seven years in a row in the StackOverflow survey.

They discuss a wide range of topics, including what it means to be a system-programming language, and what brought each of them to Rust. They ponder what it is that makes a programming language successful and, given this, consider what the future might hold for Rust.

We pick up the conversation where Chris is trying to describe the nature of Rust through a bicycle metaphor. Yes, really… and we find out later in the podcast that this metaphor works surprisingly well.
