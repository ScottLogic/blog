There is little doubt that GenAI will have an impact on almost every aspect of our business and personal lives. However, we are at an interesting juncture: models are becoming ever more powerful, with prototypes showing ever greater promise, but there remain significant challenges when it comes to the reality of putting this technology into practice. How do we take these astonishing experiments and turn them into something safe and reliable that can ultimately be trusted in the wild?

Financial services has a fairly long history with AI and machine learning. However, its place within the industry is shifting. It is no longer the exclusive tool of Data Scientists. Rather it is a tool we are placing in the hands of our engineers, product owners, and, if we are to maximise the benefits, we should be putting it in everyone's hands. But to do-so safely, we need to educate people regarding the strengths and weaknesses, the risks and opportunities this technology presents. Within FINOS, we are forming an AI readiness group that tackles some of these challenges. This talk will take a deep dive, exploring the changes we need to make as AI rapidly becomes a standard tool in our armoury
