Genuine digital transformation is not possible unless Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are embraced and understood across a whole organisation, rather than just within technical teams. In this session, I provided a non-technical introduction to APIs and their typical current state in large, longstanding organisations. I also illustrated what good looks so that you are better able to cut through much of the technical obfuscation. Finally, I explored the variety of potential benefits that APIs done ‘properly’ can bring to your organisation, bringing this to life with real-world success stories.
