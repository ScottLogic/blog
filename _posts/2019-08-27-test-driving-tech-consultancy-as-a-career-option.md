### How Harry Brooks found his summer internship in our Newcastle office.

Harry is studying for an Integrated Master’s in Computer Science at **Durham University**, and spent his summer internship in our Newcastle office.

“Being a Computer Science student, technology consultancy is one of the areas many of my peers go into, so I wanted to give it a go.”

He applied to Scott Logic as the company was already known to him through its partnership with the Computer Science department, providing **guest lectures** and **on-site interviews**. Harry was particularly keen to expand his skills and knowledge around web applications, and also get a real taste of what it’s like to build software for complex and demanding clients.

After a first week of training and inductions, Harry got stuck into his main project – ‘The Hub’, an internal system to manage company events – which involved learning **React** and building the application on **Amazon Web Services** (AWS).

“React was new to me, but I’ve enjoyed using it and believe it has helped me greatly with my web programming ability. The authentication for the website was a big challenge as there was not much guidance on it, neither from web sources nor internally. It was a new method for the company and the documentation online is less than ideal. In the end, I managed to figure it out with help from my mentor.”

Reflecting on his placement, Harry feels he’s learnt first-hand the **importance of teamwork** and the value that everybody gives to the team. **Working with clever colleagues** and developing new skills through the internship has also convinced Harry that software development should definitely form part of his future career.

“The team at Scott Logic have given me the opportunity to grow my programming and **agile** skills. The internship programme has been a great way to spend the summer, learning new skills and making new friends whilst enjoying every moment.”

And Harry’s **advice** to other undergraduates considering internship options? 

“Try and get involved with as many companies in different areas of tech as possible, and you might find an area you truly love to work in.” 

Scott Logic transforms its clients’ businesses by engineering innovative, bespoke software solutions that drive measurable value, while also enhancing the core strengths of their technology delivery capability. 

With our annual internship you can enjoy a summer season being paid to sample a challenging and rewarding career in software.
