International Women's Day (8 March) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.

In 2020, the theme for the day is #EachforEqual. Equality is not just a women's issue, it's a business issue which is why Scott Logic is celebrating International Women’s Day and continually takes strides towards further diversity and inclusion. 

In this post, we provide a roundup of some of the things we’ve been doing across the company to celebrate.

## Our blogs
Why not read some of our blog posts celebrating women in technology? These posts have all been written by women working at Scott Logic.

**Avril Fiddes, Delivery Manager**: [Encouraging women in the tech industry](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/03/07/women-in-tech.html)

“It can be hard to be a minority in any environment, which is the case for women in the software industry. At the Scott Logic Edinburgh office we’re in the great position to be able to host tech groups, and we’re keen to support women in the tech industry.”

**Auguste Bagdonaite, Developer**: [BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium 2019](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/05/01/bcswomen-lovelace-colloquium-2019.html)

“This is the summary of BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium 2019 that I attended. I had a chance to attend interesting talks and to talk with women students who attended the event and were interested in Scott Logic.”

**Chloe McKnight, Developer**: [What it’s like working in software development](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/07/19/what-its-like-working-in-software-development.html)

“Looking back on the questions I had when I was just starting out, I wanted to share my thoughts and advice to anyone interested in getting into software development.”

**Tamara Chehayeb Makarem, Lead UX Designer**: [Designing with accessibility in mind](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/09/11/Designing-with-accessibility-in-mind.html)

“The process for meeting accessibility standards can seem overwhelming. In this post, I explore three ways of approaching accessibility that make achieving it more manageable.”

**Elizabeth Fiennes, Lead Test Engineer**: [What's quality got to do with IT?](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/02/15/what-s-quality-got-to-do-with-it.html)

“What is quality? Is it 'just' testing? If not, then what else? How do you measure it? Should you even try? What does it really mean if you have 1 person or a team looking after the quality? After being told the quality was my new role, I did some research to find out the answers to these questions and more.”

**Zinat Wali, Senior Developer**: [Elasticsearch - clustering on AWS with optional auto-scaling](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/07/19/elasticsearch-clustering.html)

“Create your own Elasticsearch cluster in cloud in next to no time. Leverage ElasticHQ and CloudWatch logging to gain transparency. Excerpts from a client project.”

**Hannah Pretswell, Senior Tester**: [Software career? There is no such thing as the 'wrong degree'](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/09/05/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-wrong-degree.html)

“Continuous learning is part of our culture at Scott Logic, our test engineer Hannah volunteers as a STEM Ambassador in local schools.”

**Sioned Baker, Senior Developer**: [devtools@scale event](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/05/25/devtoolsatscale-event.html)

“This blog describes a one day event in London where leading tech companies were discussing tools they use to make their development and operations scale and be more efficient.”

## Charity Lunch

In our London office, we’re hosting a charity lunch with the proceeds going to Smart Works, a charity that supports unemployed women in need to get back into work. A number of interesting and thought-provoking discussions were had about women going into STEM subjects. We shared our thoughts on how early-age experiences and social biases have a big impact on whether people will enter a technology-based career.

Smart Works is a UK charity that provides high quality interview clothes and interview training to unemployed women in need. It harnesses the power of clothes and confidence to allow a woman to be her best at a crucial moment in her life, giving her the confidence, the self-belief and the practical tools required to succeed at interview and transform her life.

## Inspirations and experiences

Across the business we’ve asked our colleagues to share their inspirations and experiences of being a woman working in technology.
