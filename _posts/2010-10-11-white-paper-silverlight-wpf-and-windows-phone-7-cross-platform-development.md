Last week I gave a presentation at a joint Scott Logic / Microsoft event about how WPF and Silverlight are unifying the development platform for desktop, web and mobile. To accompany the talk I wrote a white paper, [which is free to download]({{site.baseurl}}/ceberhardt/assets/white-papers/wpf-silverlight.pdf), that delves into this subject in a little more detail.

I also created a cross platform application that has a 75% shared codebase between the WPF (desktop), Silverlight (web) and Windows Phone 7 (mobile) versions. I plan to share more of this at a later date.

Any thoughts, ideas or comments, please share them below.

Regards, Colin E.
