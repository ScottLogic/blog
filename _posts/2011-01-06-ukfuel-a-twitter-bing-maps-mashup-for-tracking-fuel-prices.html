summary: A few weeks ago I created a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2010/11/29/uksnow-silverlight-an-rx-powered-twitter-bing-maps-mashup">Silverlight version of the &#35uksnow Twitter mashup</a>, which plots twitter users snow reports on a UK map.

<p>A few weeks ago I created a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2010/11/29/uksnow-silverlight-an-rx-powered-twitter-bing-maps-mashup">Silverlight version of the #uksnow Twitter mashup</a>, which plots twitter users snow reports on a UK map. Yesterday I spotted a new geographically encoded hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukfuel&src=typd">#ukfuel</a>. Twitter users are using this hashtag to share local fuel prices across the UK.</p>
<p>The format of #ukfuel tweets is as follows:</p>
<pre>[postcode] [fuel type] [price]</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>DA16 UL £1.30</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>DA16 Derv £1.30</pre>
<p>I thought it would be fun to modify my mashup to plot #ukfuel prices. And here it is ...</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><object width="700" height="550" data="data:application/x-silverlight," type="application/x-silverlight-2" ><param name="source" value="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2011/01/UKFuel3.xap"/><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=124807"  style="text-decoration: none;"> <img src="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108181" alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight" style="border-style: none"/></a></object></div>
<p>The application above is a bit basic, it could be extended to search for historic #ukfuel tweets, also the #ukfuel hashtag format could do with being more well defined, I can see from various user's tweets that there is some confusion about the format they should use. However, I think #ukfuel shows great promise, and if it catches on, I plan to add features and improve on the above application.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, comments, suggestions? Please leave a comment below.</p>
<p>Regards,Colin E.</p>
