summary: In this episode Colin, Ollie, Johanna and Lily hold a lively conversation
  that dives into Web3 and the Metaverse. We ask the question “what is Web3.0”, and
  explore what it means to be a decentralised technology. We discuss the Metaverse,
  Roblox and other virtual environments, and very briefly touch on NFTs. But for the
  most part, we talk about exploration and innovation.

In this episode, I’m joined by my colleague Ollie, and guests [Johanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanna-eiramo-she-her-9b053/) from Finnish National Gallery, and [Lilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillypencheva/), a Blockchain & Web3 Specialist. As we’re discussing quite a challenging and volatile topic, I should state that the opinions raised in this podcast are personal views rather than the views of any current or former employer.

In our conversation we ask the question “what is Web3.0”, and explore what it means to be a decentralised technology. We discuss the metaverse, Roblox and other virtual environments, and very briefly touch on NFTs. But for the most part, we talk about exploration and innovation.

We join the discussion with Johanna talking about bringing digital artwork into the virtual world of the Metaverse, and their motivation for experimenting with technology.
