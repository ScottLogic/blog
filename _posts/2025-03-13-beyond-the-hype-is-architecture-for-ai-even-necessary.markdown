In this episode, I'm joined by colleagues Jess McEvoy and James Heward, and Atom Bank's Head of AI and Data Science, Russell Collingham, to tackle the provocative question: "Is architecture for AI even necessary?"

We explore the transformative impact of generative AI and the critical role of architecture in ensuring sustainable and scalable implementations. Russell shares Atom Bank's approach to building reusable AI components while navigating security and governance challenges. James emphasises the evolving role of architects in balancing innovation with practical constraints, arguing that architecture remains essential for mission-critical applications. Jess provides a public sector perspective, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to AI regulation and innovation.

We also delve into the geopolitical implications of AI, the importance of data sovereignty, and the potential for the UK to develop its own AI strategy. Have a listen to gain insights into the ongoing debate about the necessity of architecture in the AI era and the strategic considerations for leveraging AI effectively.
