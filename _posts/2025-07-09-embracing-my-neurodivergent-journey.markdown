I originally wrote this for Scott Logic's internal newsletter, but I felt that the message was important to share with a wider audience, who may also find my experiences relatable.

As you may or may not know, 16 June 2025 was World Neurodiversity Pride Day – a day to celebrate the diverse ways our brains work.

Last year, I received a combined autism and ADHD (AuDHD) diagnosis. It was a pivotal moment that helped me reframe my life, and I decided early on to be open about my diagnosis, both to advocate for myself and to let others know they’re not alone.

## The Highs and Lows of Self-Discovery

For my whole life, I felt out of place in a world that I didn’t seem to fit into. Simple situations felt overwhelming, social interactions were exhausting, and I constantly questioned why I struggled when others seemed to glide through life. 

It wasn’t until last year that I received my autism and ADHD diagnoses – along with answers that totally changed my understanding of myself.

At first, the revelation was bittersweet. I was relieved, as all the questions I had about myself finally made sense. Yet I felt grief too – how much easier might life have been with earlier support? I don’t mind admitting, I had a good cry.

But as I processed my diagnosis, I began to see my neurodivergence as something that wasn’t a problem, but as a separate set of strengths.

## The Road to Self-Acceptance

Acceptance didn’t happen overnight. Society often still has some strange ideas about autism and ADHD, and I had to unlearn my long-held belief that I was “broken”.

I began to reframe everything:

- My challenges weren’t personal failures – they were mismatches between my brain and an inflexible environment.

- My differences came with strengths, like deep focus, creativity, the ability to see beyond expectations, and unique problem-solving.

- Masking (trying to appear neurotypical) was exhausting. So, I made a conscious decision that going forward, I would allow myself to embrace my passions, and behave and communicate in ways that felt natural.

## Realising My Strengths

Once I stopped fighting my brain, I saw how my neurodivergence could be an asset.

- Hyperfocus lets me dive deeply into subjects I love, allowing me to thoroughly understand the concepts and come up with new ideas.

- Pattern recognition helps me spot connections others miss – as a tester, this is a real asset.

- Seeing things differently means that I question why things are the way they are, and challenge them constructively if they don’t make sense – another great asset for a tester.

- My own experiences, feeling like the odd person out, gave me empathy for others who feel misunderstood, fuelling my desire to advocate and amplify under-represented voices.

## Using My Voice for Others

My diagnosis didn’t just help me – it inspired me to support others like me. I decided from the start that I was going to be completely, defiantly open about my diagnosis and…

- Speak openly about my experiences to challenge stereotypes.

- Educate others on neurodiversity, whether explaining sensory needs or advocating for workplace accommodations.

- Be a supportive friend for other late-diagnosed adults who’ve spent years feeling isolated, and help others navigate the process to assessment and diagnosis.

## A Lifelong Journey

I still have days when I feel like an alien! But now I understand why, I treat myself with compassion instead of frustration. My autism and ADHD aren’t problems that need to be fixed – they’re part of what makes me who I am. 

In accepting them, I’ve found purpose, a new sense of confidence, and a deeper connection to others on similar paths.

To anyone discovering their neurodivergence later in life – you aren’t broken – your brain is just different, and different can be powerful.
