<p>Welcome to my blog, <em>Andrew's thoughts on Big Data</em>. This page gives a little background on myself and the blog.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Carr and I have been coding and generally being interested in technology since the age of 12.  I have been involved in professional Software Engineering for over 20 years now having worked for a number of blue chip companies in both Telecommunications and Financial Services.  My interest mostly lies with backend technologies, particularly those around Data Engineering or Big Data, even though I'm not hugely keen on the buzz word, I am very keen on what these new technologies enable..</p>
<p>I now work for <a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/">Scott Logic</a>, and I head up their Big Data service offering.</p>
<p>I am happy to receive any questions or feedback.</p>
