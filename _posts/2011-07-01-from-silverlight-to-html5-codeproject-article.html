<p>I have just published an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/scripting/SilverlightToHTML5.aspx">article on codeproject</a> which describes the differences in development between Silverlight and HTML5. In order to illustrate the differences, I have re-implemented my Windows Phone 7 JumpList control using HTML5/CSS3. You can see this control in action below:</p>
<p><iframe height="560" width="300" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2011/07/test.html" frameborder="0" ></iframe></p>
<p>(NOTE: this will look best in a browser that has support for CSS3 transitions and transformations. Try Google Chrome for example).</p>
<p>The control also works very well on mobile phones with webkit browsers, for example iPhone and Android. See the following video for a demonstration:</p>
