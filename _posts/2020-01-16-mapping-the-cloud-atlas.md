Whatever your organisationâ€™s particular objectives in migrating to the cloud, you will be relieved to hear that most journeys towards cloud maturity have a set of well-defined and understood steps. 
 
In this webinar, Technical Architect James Dunkerley maps out these milestones so that you can understand where you are on your cloud journey and plan your onward route towards cloud maturity. Along the way, he explores a range of cloud adoption strategies from lift-and-shift through to re-architecting.
