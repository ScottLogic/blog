## TL;DR

- Prefer HTTP for updating user state and WebSockets for broadcasting those changes.
- Minimise state changes to reduce the frequency of data transfers and re-renders.
- Updates should only transmit the necessary state changes, don't send the whole object!
- Handle unstable internet connections with periodic queries for missed events.
- Capture metrics from user testing early in development to help steer your mobile optimisation approach.

## Introduction

In this blog post we'll take a brief look at some of the lessons learned while creating a cross-platform location sharing app.

Why did I make this app? Well, have a think - how many apps on your phone have the ability to share the real-time location of taxis, deliveries or people? After all, [the map itself is enough for some people](https://www.geoguessr.com)! There's a lot you can do here, but I settled on an app based on real-world exploration with small groups of friends. With any luck, it'll be released in the near future so I'll only be speaking in relation to a subset of the core functionality / example code.

Using Angular with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/), I was able to build a cross-platform app using native features and view components with a single codebase. Some of the key features include:

- Authentication with Google SSO
- Share location data with other users
- Match location with pre-configured GPS landmarks server-side
- Render avatars on a map and update user locations in real-time

You can find [details of the architecture and deployment at the end of the article](#bonus-content---a-closer-look-at-how-the-app-works) but for now let's jump right into the findings from early user testing.

## Findings from Test #1 with real users

During a 1 hour test with 3 users here's what I found:

- It used up a lot of battery
- Data usage was much higher than expected (2GB per device on average)
- Some of the state changes were completely missed (the app also broadcasts other important information)

Clearly it needed some rethinking before the next test group. So what went wrong?

### 1. A bad web socket integration

Can you spot what is wrong with this implementation and why it could be linked to such high data usage?

TK **show code snippet of original web sockets implementation**

I had accidentally nested the socket listeners inside each active socket connection which meant the number of actions scales logarithmically proportional to the number of active users. Whoops! To make matters worse, some of these actions had side-effects which triggered another re-broadcast of the data, meaning those were sent out again too. This was a small bug but a huge oversight in my original approach that used far too much data.

How did I miss this during development? Well, I:

- Only tested it for a short amount of time
- Was connected to a stable internet connection (Ethernet / WIFI)
- Was plugged into a power outlet

These are the kind of things you'll really have to think about when developing for mobile as resources genuinely are limited.

Here's what it should've look like all along.

### 2. Frequency of data changes

I wanted location data to update as often as possible in order to display the most recent locations on the map. However, I didn't really appreciate just how much data comes in when you're constantly streaming updates from a number of users. In order to reduce the amount of data being sent, I found a happy medium of only emitting location changes after a minimum of 10 meters had been travelled. In order to retain the smooth visual transition between updates, the avatars were animated from location A to location B.

### 3. Which data is actually being sent

One that could have been improved was the content of the data that was being sent. If one of the fields in the user object updated, the whole user object was sent. As it turns out, this is a huge waste of resources. This was exaggerated even more due the high volume of updates coming from the users.

### 4. Unstable internet connections

How often do you have a reliable connection on your phone when you're out and about? Will it stay connected if you go inside a building? It's not unlikely you'll be disconnected at some point - so what happens if you miss a WebSocket update?

I didn't fancy over-engineering just yet so I settled on intermittently querying different parts of the backend to ask for various app states. More time sensitive data points were pinged more often. This was a great little trick to catch up on missed events but just to reiterate - make sure you carefully consider the frequency.

With these issues addressed and additional features added to the app, I ran another test with real users.

## Findings from Test #2 with real users

During a 2 hour test with 9 users here's what I found:

- Battery usage was lower than before üëè
- Data usage was much lower than before (using 100MB per device on average) üëè
- If a user missed an update from the web socket, they received it shortly after üëè

The second test lasted twice as long, had three times as many users, and we still managed to use 95% less data? Nice!

Don't get me wrong - some bugs still cropped up, but that first test revealed many issues that I was able to address before the second test. This is why we test things in the real world with real users! If there's a bug, they'll probably find it.

## Summary

I believe that these real-world tests have effectively showcased the advantages of an iterative development and testing approach. Through this process, we were able to spot issues at an early stage, gain valuable insights from them, and enhance our product. It is clear that efficiency and optimization play a pivotal role in mobile app development.
--TK-- but why - only have limited resources, need to use them as efficiently as possible

The main point to remember here is that prioritising performance is crucial in mobile app development, even when using a web framework like Angular. By applying these lessons, we can create apps that perform better, respond faster, and use less data.

To simplify implementation details we'll forgo security considerations and data persistence in these examples.

### Architecture

Let's have a look at how it all comes together. Who doesn't love an architecture diagram?

**(If you're not interested in the technical details then [click here](#summary) to skip straight to the summary...)**

### A NodeJS backend

All we need for the backend is a service to hold the user information and a controller to communicate with the users:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgill-a/711607e67bd6877cb04be44fa52bcdfa.js"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgill-a/c9f01e36196a983019c151b33c859ad1.js"></script>

We can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to make sure actions (join, leave, update position) are broadcasted over WebSockets:

### An Angular frontend

There's a lot of moving parts in the frontend, but we can simplify it by focusing on a few key areas:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgill-a/db12926331f47f3a8672a996b9067a12.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgill-a/9c3614132b842f217fa8c97bdfa43e0e.js"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgill-a/7f92a1d32fed02b5dd4541ba53483aed.js"></script>

Integrate the real-time data into [Angular Google Maps](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/google-maps#readme) and suddenly we've got a location sharing app:

### The deployment

The mobile version of the app is built using capacitor and distributed to the test users via OneDrive (very high tech, I know).

The web version of the app is automatically deployed to Firebase and is set up with temporary deployments for PRs.

![Github Action adding a comment to my PR with a deployed version of the code change for testing]({{ site.github.url }}/amcgill/assets/firebase-pr-action.png "Firebase PR deployments")

The backend is automatically deployed to a Heroku Basic Dyno instance for $7/month. I was hoping to use Firebase here as well since it's free, unfortunately cloud functions do not support web sockets since they only handle a single request/response.
