# The Focus DSL: Traversals and Pattern Rewrites

*Part 4 of the Functional Optics for Modern Java series*


In [Part 1]({{site.baseurl}}/2026/01/09/java-the-immutability-gap.html) and [Part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/2026/01/16/optics-fundamentals.html), 
we established why optics matter and how they work. In [Part 3]({{site.baseurl}}/2026/01/23/ast-basic-optics.html),
we built our expression language AST and applied basic optics using lenses for field access and prisms for variant matching.  
Finally, we created a simple optimiser, but left things hanging with a fundamental limitation that we shall address now:
_How do we visit **all** nodes in a tree, not just the top level?_

This is where traversals come into play as the essential tool. A traversal focuses on zero or more elements within a structure, making it perfect for recursive tree operations.

The [Focus DSL](https://higher-kinded-j.github.io/latest/optics/ch4_intro.html) provides `TraversalPath`: a fluent wrapper around traversals that makes collection navigation more readable and composable. By the end of this article, we'll be writing code like:

~~~~ java
// Navigate all employees in all departments, modify their salaries
Company updated = CompanyFocus.departments()
    .each()                              // Traverse each department
    .employees()                         // Navigate to employees list
    .each()                              // Traverse each employee
    .salary()                            // Focus on salary field
    .modifyAll(s -> s.multiply(1.1), company);
~~~~

No manual recursion. No reconstruction boilerplate. Just a fluent path that describes what you want.

## Traversals as Garden Pruning

Before diving into code, consider an analogy. Imagine you're pruning a tree in a garden. You need to visit every branch, decide what to do at each one, and rebuild the tree with your changes. You have two strategies:

- **Bottom-up (leaves first)**: Start at the leaf tips, prune outward branches, then work your way down. Each branch is trimmed after its subbranches are done. This is perfect when you need to see the final state of subbranches before deciding on the parent.

- **Top-down (trunk first)**: Start at the trunk, make decisions about major branches first, then work outward. Each branch is examined before its subbranches. This works when you want to make early decisions that affect the whole subtree.

In programming, a *traversal* is exactly this: a systematic way to visit every node in a tree structure, with a strategy for when to act on each node relative to its children. The Focus DSL makes this as natural as describing which branches to visit.

---

## The Recursive Challenge

Consider our expression AST. When we write `(x + 1) * (y + 2)`, we get:

~~~~ java
new Binary(
    new Binary(new Variable("x"), ADD, new Literal(1)),
    MUL,
    new Binary(new Variable("y"), ADD, new Literal(2))
)
~~~~

Visualised as a tree:
![mfj-traversal-rewrite-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/magnussmith/assets/optics/mfj-traversal-rewrite-1.png "Binary Tree")

This tree has seven nodes: three `Binary` expressions, two `Variable` nodes, and two `Literal` nodes. If we want to find all variables, we can't just look at the top level; we need to descend into every branch.

As we discussed in Part 3, the traditional Visitor pattern requires substantial boilerplate: an interface, accept methods in each node, and a visitor implementation for every operation. Even with Java 25's pattern matching, we still face the reconstruction cascade for transformations.

Traversals offer something better: define the traversal structure once, then use it for any operation.

---

## Building a Universal Expression Traversal

A `Traversal<S, A>` focuses on zero or more `A` values within an `S` structure. For expressions, we want `Traversal<Expr, Expr>`: a traversal that visits all subexpressions within an expression.

First, let's define what "all subexpressions" means for each variant:

| Expression Type | Sub-expressions |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `Literal` | None |
| `Variable` | None |
| `Binary` | `left`, `right` |
| `Conditional` | `cond`, `then_`, `else_` |

Here's the traversal implementation:

~~~~ java
public final class ExprTraversal {

    /**
     * A traversal targeting all immediate children of an expression.
     * Does not descend recursively; use with transform utilities for full tree traversal.
     */
    public static Traversal<Expr, Expr> children() {
        return new Traversal<>() {
            @Override
            public <F> Kind<F, Expr> modifyF(
                    Function<Expr, Kind<F, Expr>> f,
                    Expr source,
                    Applicative<F> applicative) {
                return switch (source) {
                    case Literal _ -> applicative.of(source);
                    case Variable _ -> applicative.of(source);
                    case Binary(var l, var op, var r) ->
                        applicative.map2(f.apply(l), f.apply(r),
                            (newL, newR) -> new Binary(newL, op, newR));
                    case Conditional(var c, var t, var e) ->
                        applicative.map3(f.apply(c), f.apply(t), f.apply(e),
                            (newC, newT, newE) -> new Conditional(newC, newT, newE));
                };
            }
        };
    }
}
~~~~

This is effect-polymorphic: the same traversal works with any `Applicative` functor. We can use it for pure transformations, error-accumulating validation, or stateful operations. (Don't worry if "effect-polymorphic" is unfamiliar; we'll explore this concept further. For now, just know it means this same traversal code works whether you're doing pure transformations, error handling, or validation.)

For simpler use cases, Higher-Kinded-J provides the `Traversals.modify` utility:

~~~~ java
import org.higherkindedj.optics.util.Traversals;

// Apply a pure transformation to all children
Expr result = Traversals.modify(children(), f, expr);
~~~~

This handles the `Id` effect internally, giving you a clean API for pure transformations.

### The Focus DSL Alternative: TraversalPath

While the raw `Traversal` interface provides maximum control, the Focus DSL offers a more ergonomic API for everyday use. `TraversalPath` wraps a traversal and provides fluent methods:

~~~~ java
import org.higherkindedj.optics.focus.TraversalPath;
import org.higherkindedj.optics.focus.FocusPaths;

// Create a TraversalPath from our children traversal
TraversalPath<Expr, Expr> childrenPath = TraversalPath.fromTraversal(children());

// Now we have fluent operations:
List<Expr> allChildren = childrenPath.getAll(expr);           // Collect all children
Expr modified = childrenPath.modifyAll(this::optimise, expr); // Transform all children
~~~~

The Focus DSL becomes even more powerful with collection navigation. For lists, use `each()`:

~~~~ java
// Given a department with a list of employees
FocusPath<Department, List<Employee>> staffPath = DepartmentFocus.staff();

// Navigate into the list with each()
TraversalPath<Department, Employee> allStaff = staffPath.each();

// Now we can operate on all employees:
List<Employee> employees = allStaff.getAll(department);
Department updated = allStaff.modifyAll(Employee::promote, department);
~~~~

The `each()` method is the key: it transforms a `FocusPath<S, List<A>>` into a `TraversalPath<S, A>`. This pattern scales to nested structures, as we'll see throughout this article.

### Deep Traversal: Visiting All Descendants

The `children()` traversal only visits immediate children. For full tree traversal, we combine it with recursive descent:

~~~~ java
/**
 * Transform all nodes in the tree from leaves to root (bottom-up).
 * Each node is transformed after its children.
 */
public static Expr transformBottomUp(Expr expr, Function<Expr, Expr> f) {
    // First transform all children recursively
    Expr transformed = Traversals.modify(
        children(),
        child -> transformBottomUp(child, f),
        expr
    );
    // Then transform this node
    return f.apply(transformed);
}

/**
 * Transform all nodes in the tree from root to leaves (top-down).
 * Each node is transformed before its children.
 */
public static Expr transformTopDown(Expr expr, Function<Expr, Expr> f) {
    // First transform this node
    Expr transformed = f.apply(expr);
    // Then transform all children recursively
    return Traversals.modify(
        children(),
        child -> transformTopDown(child, f),
        transformed
    );
}
~~~~

The choice between bottom-up and top-down matters:

- **Bottom-up**: Children are transformed first. Use this when transformations depend on the structure of children (like constant folding, where we need to fold `1 + 2` before we can simplify `(1 + 2) * 3`).

- **Top-down**: The node is transformed first. Use this when you want to pattern-match on the original structure before children change (like macro expansion).

Here's the traversal order visualised:

![mfj-traversal-rewrite-2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/magnussmith/assets/optics/mfj-traversal-rewrite-2.png "Bottom-up Top-down Trees")


For constant folding, bottom-up is essential: we need to evaluate `1 + 2` at the leaves before we can recognise that the parent is now `3 * 5`.

### Focus DSL: The Practical Choice

For most use cases, the Focus DSL provides what you need without writing custom traversals. Here's the pattern for nested structures:

~~~~ java
@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Company(String name, List<Department> departments) {}

@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Department(String name, List<Employee> employees, Employee manager) {}

@GenerateFocus(generateNavigators = true)
record Employee(String name, BigDecimal salary, Address address) {}

// Navigate all the way to employee addresses:
TraversalPath<Company, Address> allEmployeeAddresses = CompanyFocus
    .departments().each()          // Into each department
    .employees().each()            // Into each employee
    .address();                    // To their address

// Get all addresses
List<Address> addresses = allEmployeeAddresses.getAll(company);

// Relocate all employees
Company relocated = allEmployeeAddresses.modifyAll(
    addr -> new Address("New HQ", addr.city(), addr.postcode()),
    company
);
~~~~

With navigators enabled, cross-type navigation happens automatically. No explicit `via()` calls, no manual composition. The path reads like English: _"company's departments, each one's employees, each one's address."_


---

## Collecting Information

Traversals aren't just for modification; they're equally powerful for extraction. We use *folds* to aggregate information from all focused elements.

### Finding All Variables

~~~~ java
public static Set<String> findVariables(Expr expr) {
    Set<String> vars = new HashSet<>();
    collectVariables(expr, vars);
    return vars;
}

private static void collectVariables(Expr expr, Set<String> accumulator) {
    switch (expr) {
        case Variable(var name) -> accumulator.add(name);
        case Literal _ -> { }
        case Binary(var l, _, var r) -> {
            collectVariables(l, accumulator);
            collectVariables(r, accumulator);
        }
        case Conditional(var c, var t, var e) -> {
            collectVariables(c, accumulator);
            collectVariables(t, accumulator);
            collectVariables(e, accumulator);
        }
    }
}
~~~~

With the Focus DSL, we can make this more readable:

~~~~ java
public static Set<String> findVariables(Expr expr) {
    // Create a TraversalPath that focuses on all Variable nodes
    TraversalPath<Expr, Expr> allNodes = ExprFocus.universe();  // All descendants

    // Filter to variables and extract names
    return allNodes.getAll(expr).stream()
        .filter(e -> e instanceof Variable)
        .map(e -> ((Variable) e).name())
        .collect(Collectors.toSet());
}
~~~~

Or using `foldMap` on the TraversalPath for a more functional approach:

~~~~ java
public static Set<String> findVariables(Expr expr) {
    TraversalPath<Expr, Expr> allNodes = ExprFocus.universe();
    return allNodes.foldMap(
        Monoids.set(),
        e -> e instanceof Variable(var name) ? Set.of(name) : Set.of(),
        expr
    );
}
~~~~

The `foldMap` method on `TraversalPath` traverses all focused elements and combines results using a monoid (here, set union).

### Counting Nodes by Type

~~~~ java
public record NodeCounts(int literals, int variables, int binaries, int conditionals) {
    public static NodeCounts ZERO = new NodeCounts(0, 0, 0, 0);

    public NodeCounts add(NodeCounts other) {
        return new NodeCounts(
            literals + other.literals,
            variables + other.variables,
            binaries + other.binaries,
            conditionals + other.conditionals
        );
    }
}

public static NodeCounts countNodes(Expr expr) {
    return foldMap(
        expr,
        e -> switch (e) {
            case Literal _ -> new NodeCounts(1, 0, 0, 0);
            case Variable _ -> new NodeCounts(0, 1, 0, 0);
            case Binary _ -> new NodeCounts(0, 0, 1, 0);
            case Conditional _ -> new NodeCounts(0, 0, 0, 1);
        },
        NodeCounts::add
    );
}
~~~~

### The foldMap Implementation

~~~~ java
public static <A> A foldMap(Expr expr, Function<Expr, A> extract, BinaryOperator<A> combine) {
    A current = extract.apply(expr);
    return switch (expr) {
        case Literal _, Variable _ -> current;
        case Binary(var l, _, var r) ->
            combine.apply(current,
                combine.apply(foldMap(l, extract, combine),
                              foldMap(r, extract, combine)));
        case Conditional(var c, var t, var e) ->
            combine.apply(current,
                combine.apply(foldMap(c, extract, combine),
                    combine.apply(foldMap(t, extract, combine),
                                  foldMap(e, extract, combine))));
    };
}
~~~~

---

## Filtered Traversals and Conditional Updates

Sometimes we only want to focus on certain elements. The Focus DSL provides `modifyWhen()` for conditional updates and filtering capabilities for targeted navigation.

### Conditional Modification with modifyWhen

The `modifyWhen` method is perfect for targeted updates:

~~~~ java
// Give a raise only to employees earning below a threshold
TraversalPath<Company, Employee> allEmployees = CompanyFocus
    .departments().each()
    .employees().each();

Company updated = allEmployees.modifyWhen(
    emp -> emp.salary().compareTo(threshold) < 0,  // Predicate
    emp -> emp.withSalary(emp.salary().multiply(1.15)),  // Transformation
    company
);
~~~~

This is cleaner than filtering after the fact: the predicate and transformation are co-located, making the intent clear.

### Targeting Only Binary Additions

For our expression language, we might want to target specific node types:

~~~~ java
public static Expr doubleAllAdditions(Expr expr) {
    return transformBottomUp(expr, e -> {
        if (e instanceof Binary(var l, BinaryOp.ADD, var r)) {
            // Transform a + b into (a + b) + (a + b)
            return new Binary(e, BinaryOp.ADD, e);
        }
        return e;
    });
}
~~~~

### Using Prisms for Type-Safe Filtering

The Focus DSL integrates beautifully with prisms for sum type navigation:

~~~~ java
public static List<BinaryOp> findAllOperators(Expr expr) {
    // Navigate to all Binary nodes using instanceOf
    TraversalPath<Expr, Binary> allBinaries = ExprFocus.universe()
        .via(AffinePath.instanceOf(Binary.class));

    return allBinaries.getAll(expr).stream()
        .map(Binary::op)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
~~~~

The `AffinePath.instanceOf()` creates an affine path that focuses on elements of a specific type. When composed with a traversal, it filters to only matching elements.

### Sum Type Navigation with instanceOf

For sealed interfaces, `instanceOf` is particularly powerful:

~~~~ java
// Focus on all Circle shapes in a drawing
TraversalPath<Drawing, Circle> circles = DrawingFocus.shapes()
    .each()
    .via(AffinePath.instanceOf(Circle.class));

// Double all circle radii
Drawing updated = circles.modifyAll(
    c -> new Circle(c.radius() * 2),
    drawing
);
~~~~

This pattern combines the type safety of sealed interfaces with the composability of the Focus DSL. The compiler ensures exhaustiveness while the DSL provides elegant navigation.

---

## Implementing Optimisation Passes

With traversals in place, we can build sophisticated optimisation passes. Each pass is a transformation function; the optimiser composes them.

### Pass 1: Constant Folding

Evaluate operations where both operands are literals:

~~~~ java
public static Expr foldConstants(Expr expr) {
    return transformBottomUp(expr, ExprOptimiser::foldConstant);
}

private static Expr foldConstant(Expr expr) {
    if (expr instanceof Binary(Literal(var l), var op, Literal(var r))) {
        return evaluateBinary(l, op, r)
            .map(result -> (Expr) new Literal(result))
            .orElse(expr);
    }
    return expr;
}

private static Optional<Object> evaluateBinary(Object left, BinaryOp op, Object right) {
    return switch (op) {
        case ADD -> evaluateAdd(left, right);
        case SUB -> evaluateSub(left, right);
        case MUL -> evaluateMul(left, right);
        case DIV -> evaluateDiv(left, right);
        case AND -> evaluateAnd(left, right);
        case OR -> evaluateOr(left, right);
        case EQ -> Optional.of(left.equals(right));
        case NE -> Optional.of(!left.equals(right));
        case LT, LE, GT, GE -> evaluateComparison(left, op, right);
    };
}
~~~~

### Pass 2: Identity Simplification

Remove operations that don't change the result:

~~~~ java
public static Expr simplifyIdentities(Expr expr) {
    return transformBottomUp(expr, ExprOptimiser::simplifyIdentity);
}

private static Expr simplifyIdentity(Expr expr) {
    return switch (expr) {
        // x + 0 → x, 0 + x → x
        case Binary(var x, ADD, Literal(Integer i)) when i == 0 -> x;
        case Binary(Literal(Integer i), ADD, var x) when i == 0 -> x;

        // x * 1 → x, 1 * x → x
        case Binary(var x, MUL, Literal(Integer i)) when i == 1 -> x;
        case Binary(Literal(Integer i), MUL, var x) when i == 1 -> x;

        // x * 0 → 0, 0 * x → 0
        case Binary(_, MUL, Literal(Integer i)) when i == 0 -> new Literal(0);
        case Binary(Literal(Integer i), MUL, _) when i == 0 -> new Literal(0);

        // x && true → x, true && x → x
        case Binary(var x, AND, Literal(Boolean b)) when b -> x;
        case Binary(Literal(Boolean b), AND, var x) when b -> x;

        // x || false → x, false || x → x
        case Binary(var x, OR, Literal(Boolean b)) when !b -> x;
        case Binary(Literal(Boolean b), OR, var x) when !b -> x;

        // x && false → false
        case Binary(_, AND, Literal(Boolean b)) when !b -> new Literal(false);
        case Binary(Literal(Boolean b), AND, _) when !b -> new Literal(false);

        // x || true → true
        case Binary(_, OR, Literal(Boolean b)) when b -> new Literal(true);
        case Binary(Literal(Boolean b), OR, _) when b -> new Literal(true);

        default -> expr;
    };
}
~~~~

### Pass 3: Dead Branch Elimination

Remove conditional branches with constant conditions:

~~~~ java
public static Expr eliminateDeadBranches(Expr expr) {
    return transformBottomUp(expr, ExprOptimiser::eliminateDeadBranch);
}

private static Expr eliminateDeadBranch(Expr expr) {
    return switch (expr) {
        case Conditional(Literal(Boolean b), var t, var e) -> b ? t : e;
        default -> expr;
    };
}
~~~~

### Pass 4: Common Subexpression Detection

Identify repeated subexpressions (useful for let-binding which we will see to in Part 5):

~~~~ java
public static Map<Expr, Integer> findCommonSubexpressions(Expr expr) {
    Map<Expr, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
    countSubexpressions(expr, counts);
    // Return only expressions that appear more than once
    return counts.entrySet().stream()
        .filter(e -> e.getValue() > 1)
        .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue));
}

private static void countSubexpressions(Expr expr, Map<Expr, Integer> counts) {
    counts.merge(expr, 1, Integer::sum);
    switch (expr) {
        case Binary(var l, _, var r) -> {
            countSubexpressions(l, counts);
            countSubexpressions(r, counts);
        }
        case Conditional(var c, var t, var e) -> {
            countSubexpressions(c, counts);
            countSubexpressions(t, counts);
            countSubexpressions(e, counts);
        }
        default -> { }
    }
}
~~~~

---

## Extending the AST: Source Locations

Real compilers need to track where expressions come from for error messages. Let's extend our AST with source location metadata.

~~~~ java
public record SourceLocation(String file, int line, int column) {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return file + ":" + line + ":" + column;
    }
}

public record Located<T>(T value, SourceLocation location) {
    public <U> Located<U> map(Function<T, U> f) {
        return new Located<>(f.apply(value), location);
    }
}
~~~~

Now we can create `Located<Expr>` to track positions. Here lies a question in that when we transform an expression, what happens to the location?

### Preserving Locations Through Transformations

~~~~ java
public static Located<Expr> transformPreservingLocation(
        Located<Expr> located,
        Function<Expr, Expr> f) {
    return located.map(f);
}
~~~~

For more sophisticated location handling (like updating locations when inlining code), [indexed optics become valuable](https://higher-kinded-j.github.io/latest/optics/indexed_optics.html).

---

## The Complete Optimiser

Combining all passes into a single optimiser:

~~~~ java
public final class ExprOptimiser {

    /**
     * Run all optimisation passes until the expression stops changing.
     */
    public static Expr optimise(Expr expr) {
        Expr current = expr;
        Expr previous;

        do {
            previous = current;
            current = runAllPasses(current);
        } while (!current.equals(previous));

        return current;
    }

    private static Expr runAllPasses(Expr expr) {
        Expr result = expr;
        result = foldConstants(result);
        result = simplifyIdentities(result);
        result = eliminateDeadBranches(result);
        return result;

The fixed-point iteration ensures we catch cascading simplifications:

 For example:

### Example: Complex Optimisation

~~~~ java
// if (true && (1 < 2)) then (x + 0) * 1 else y
Expr complex = new Conditional(
    new Binary(new Literal(true), AND,
        new Binary(new Literal(1), LT, new Literal(2))),
    new Binary(
        new Binary(new Variable("x"), ADD, new Literal(0)),
        MUL,
        new Literal(1)),
    new Variable("y")
);

Expr optimised = ExprOptimiser.optimise(complex);
// Result: Variable("x")
~~~~

The optimiser:

1. Folds `1 < 2` → `true`
2. Simplifies `true && true` → `true`
3. Eliminates the dead else-branch
4. Simplifies `x + 0` → `x`
5. Simplifies `x * 1` → `x`

All through composable, declarative transformations.

## Bridging to the [Effect Path API](https://higher-kinded-j.github.io/latest/effect/ch_intro.html)

### What is effect-polymorphism?

In functional programming, an effect is any computational context beyond returning a plain value; things like _"might fail," "might be absent," "accumulates errors," or "carries state."_

Effect-polymorphism means writing code once that works with any of these contexts. Instead of writing separate versions of a traversal for _"transform purely," "transform with possible failure," and "transform while accumulating errors,"_ we write a single generic version that is parameterised by the effect type. The traversal doesn't care which effect you use; it just requires that the effect supports certain operations (specifically, the `Applicative` interface).
This is what `modifyF` provides: the `F` is a placeholder for any effect, so the same traversal logic handles pure transformations, validation, state threading, or any other effect you plug in.

The TraversalPath we've built throughout this article navigates and transforms data structures. But what happens when transformations might fail, or when we need to accumulate errors from multiple elements?

Higher-Kinded-J's **Effect Path API** provides the answer. Effect Paths wrap computations in contexts like `Maybe` (optional), `Either` (fail-fast errors), or `Validated` (accumulated errors). The Focus DSL bridges directly to these effect types.

### From Focus Paths to Effect Paths

Every Focus path type provides bridge methods to enter the effect world:

~~~~ java
// FocusPath<S, A> bridges to effects
FocusPath<Employee, String> namePath = EmployeeFocus.name();

MaybePath<String> maybeName = namePath.toMaybePath(employee);
EitherPath<Error, String> eitherName = namePath.toEitherPath(employee);
~~~~

For AffinePath (which might not find a value), the bridge handles the missing case:

~~~~ java
// AffinePath<S, A> handles optionality
AffinePath<User, String> nicknamePath = UserFocus.nickname();  // Optional field

MaybePath<String> maybeNickname = nicknamePath.toMaybePath(user);
// Returns Maybe.just(name) or Maybe.nothing()

EitherPath<String, String> eitherNickname =
    nicknamePath.toEitherPath(user, "No nickname set");
// Returns Either.right(name) or Either.left("No nickname set")
~~~~


### What's Ahead: The Effect Path API

Beyond optics and the Focus DSL, Higher-Kinded-J provides the **Effect Path API**: a fluent interface for computations that might fail, accumulate errors, or require deferred execution. The Effect Path types follow the "railway" metaphor where values travel along success or failure tracks:

![mfj-traversal-rewrite-5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/magnussmith/assets/optics/mfj-traversal-rewrite-5.png "Railway")

The core Effect Path types include:

| Effect Path | Wraps | Use Case |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| `MaybePath<A>` | `Maybe` | Optional values (might be absent) |
| `EitherPath<E, A>` | `Either` | Fail-fast error handling |
| `ValidationPath<E, A>` | `Validated` | Error accumulation |
| `TryPath<A>` | `Try` | Exception handling |
| `IOPath<A>` | `IO` | Deferred side effects |

**Understanding the underlying effect types:**

- **[Maybe](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-core/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/hkt/maybe/Maybe.java)**: Represents a value that might be absent, similar to `Optional` but with richer composition. Use when a value simply might not exist.

- **[Either](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-core/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/hkt/either/Either.java)**: Represents a value that is either a `Left` (typically an error) or a `Right` (the success value). Fails fast on the first error encountered.

- **[Validated](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-core/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/hkt/validated/Validated.java)**: Like `Either`, but designed for error *accumulation*. When combining multiple validations, collects all errors rather than stopping at the first.

- **[Try](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-core/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/hkt/trymonad/Try.java)**: Captures computations that might throw exceptions. Converts exception-throwing code into values you can compose safely.

- **[IO](https://github.com/higher-kinded-j/higher-kinded-j/blob/main/hkj-core/src/main/java/org/higherkindedj/hkt/io/IO.java)**: Represents a deferred side effect. The computation is described but not executed until explicitly run, enabling pure functional composition of effectful operations.

These types integrate seamlessly with Focus paths via bridge methods:

~~~~ java
// Navigate to a field, then enter the Effect Path world
FocusPath<User, String> emailPath = UserFocus.email();
~~~~

### Effect Paths with Traversals

TraversalPath works with Effect Paths through `modifyF`. This is the bridge to effect-polymorphic operations:

~~~~ java
// Validate all employees in a company
TraversalPath<Company, Employee> allEmployees = CompanyFocus
    .departments().each()
    .employees().each();

// Bridge to ValidationPath for error accumulation
ValidationPath<List<Error>, Company> validated = Path.valid(company, Semigroups.list())
    .via(c -> {
        // Use modifyF with Validated applicative for error accumulation
        Kind<ValidatedKind.Witness<List<Error>>, Company> result = allEmployees.modifyF(
            emp -> validateEmployee(emp),
            c,
            validatedApplicative
        );
        return VALIDATED.narrow(result);
    });
~~~~

### The Railway Model

Effect Paths follow the "railway" pattern where values travel along success or failure tracks:
![mfj-traversal-rewrite-5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/magnussmith/assets/optics/mfj-traversal-rewrite-5.png "Railway pattern")


This pattern enables comprehensive validation rather than fail-fast behaviour. The `ValidationPath` accumulates all errors using a `Semigroup`, so users see every problem at once.

### Preview: Effect-Polymorphic Traversals

In Part 5, we'll explore the Effect Path API in depth. The key takeaway is that the same Focus paths work with different effect types:

~~~~ java
// Same path, different effects
TraversalPath<Expr, Expr> allChildren = ExprFocus.children();

// Pure transformation
Expr optimised = allChildren.modifyAll(this::optimise, expr);

// With Maybe (might fail)
MaybePath<Expr> maybeResult = Path.just(expr)
    .via(e -> allChildren.modifyF(this::tryOptimise, e, maybeApplicative));

// With Validated (accumulate errors)
ValidationPath<List<Error>, Expr> validated = Path.valid(expr, Semigroups.list())
    .via(e -> allChildren.modifyF(this::validateNode, e, validatedApplicative));
~~~~

The Effect Path API turns the theoretical power of `modifyF` into a practical, fluent interface.

## Summary

This article introduced traversals and the Focus DSL's `TraversalPath` for recursive manipulation:

1. **TraversalPath**: Fluent wrapper for traversals with `getAll()`, `modifyAll()`, `foldMap()`
2. **Collection Navigation**: `each()` for lists, `at()` for indices, `atKey()` for maps
3. **Conditional Updates**: `modifyWhen()` for predicate-based transformations
4. **Sum Type Navigation**: `AffinePath.instanceOf()` for type-safe variant targeting
5. **Deep Traversal**: Bottom-up and top-down recursive descent
6. **Composable Optimiser**: Multiple passes running to fixed point

The Focus DSL separates *what* to visit from *what* to do. Build paths declaratively, then apply operations fluently. This is the optics philosophy made accessible.

### The Higher-Kinded-J Advantage for Tree Operations

The Focus DSL transforms what could be tedious tree manipulation into expressive, readable code. Consider what we achieved:

1. **Fluent navigation with TraversalPath**: Instead of writing custom traversals, we chain methods: `.departments().each().employees().each().salary()`. The path describes the data shape, not the mechanics of traversal.

2. **Collection navigation built-in**: Methods like `each()`, `at()`, and `atKey()` handle the common cases. No need to write `Traversals.list()` and compose it manually.

3. **Conditional updates with modifyWhen**: Target specific elements with predicates directly on the path. The intent is clear and the implementation is correct by construction.

4. **Sum type integration**: `AffinePath.instanceOf()` bridges sealed interfaces with the Focus DSL. Navigate to specific variants type-safely.

5. **Effect polymorphism underneath**: The Focus DSL wraps Higher-Kinded-J's effect-polymorphic traversals. When you need `modifyF` for validation or state, the same paths work.

The Focus DSL embodies the principle: common things should be easy, powerful things should be possible. Most operations use the fluent API; when you need maximum control, the underlying traversals are always accessible.

## What's Next

We've built a powerful foundation for tree manipulation with the Focus DSL. Our `TraversalPath` chains can visit every node, `foldMap` can aggregate information, and optimisation passes compose cleanly.

But we've been working with pure transformations. Real compilers need effects:

- **Type checking** should accumulate errors, not fail on the first one
- **Interpretation** needs to track variable bindings (state)
- **Optimisation** might need logging for debugging

In Part 5, we'll explore effect-polymorphic optics with `modifyF`. The Focus DSL integrates seamlessly:

~~~~ java
// Preview: effectful modification through Focus paths
Kind<ValidatedKind.Witness<List<TypeError>>, Employee> result =
    employeePath.modifyF(
        emp -> validateEmployee(emp),  // Returns Validated
        employee,
        validatedApplicative
    );
~~~~

The same Focus paths we've built work with `Validated` for error accumulation, `State` for environment threading, and any other effect. Higher-Kinded-J provides the type-class instances that make this polymorphism possible.

We'll see how `Validated` differs from `Either` (accumulating all errors rather than short-circuiting), how `State` threads environment bindings through interpretation, and how these effects compose with Focus paths. The expression language will gain a full type system and interpreter, all built on the same Focus DSL foundations.

### Next time

Real compilers and interpreters need more. Type checking should report all errors, not just the first one. 
Interpretation must track variable bindings as it descends through the tree. 
These are effects, and they change everything.

Next time, in [Part 5]({{site.baseurl}}/2026/02/09/effect-polymorphic-optics.html) we take a closer look at how effects help structure our code.
