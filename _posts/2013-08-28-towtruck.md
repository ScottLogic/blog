The Open Web is cool :).  One of the things I most enjoy about modern web
development is that so much of the code is open and able to be mashed
together.

We were talking in the office about collaborative editing.  I remembered
having seen a link to Mozilla's [Tow
Truck](https://blog.mozilla.org/labs/2013/09/reintroducing-togetherjs-formerly-known-as-towtruck/), and thought I should try it out.

TowTruck gives users of a website the ability to collaborate on using the
site.  You can see where your friend's mouse is, it's got built-in text- and
voice-chat and changes to page state are mirrored.

It's really simple to get started: all the local smarts are in a single
JavaScript file, and Mozilla runs a service which you can use freely.  All the
[source is available](https://togetherjs.com/source/) so you can run your
own server if you'd prefer.  This means that you don't have to install any
software locally: a simple example of a TowTruck-using page is only a few
lines long:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>TowTruck</title>
        <script src="https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/towtruck.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button onclick="TowTruck(this); return false;">Start TowTruck</button><br>
        <textarea spellcheck="false" style="width:100%; height:100%"></textarea>
      </body>
    </html>

I've [put this page online](https://ares.aylett.co.uk/towtruck.html), so you
can try it out.  Click the button, then share the link with a friend or open
it yourself in a separate tab or a different browser.  When you edit text in
the textarea, your changes will be mirrored.


Having come this far, I thought I could take it a bit further -- we can edit
text together at the moment, but we can't save what we've written.
[Hastebin](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) is an open-source paste
server.  I've got a (private) instance of this running, and I don't make much
use of the Twitter integration, so I decided to replace it with TowTruck
integration.  It really is as simple as adding the `<script>` tag to the HTML
and changing the JavaScript to call `TowTruck(this)` instead of opening a new
window to Twitter.  I've pushed [my
modifications](https://github.com/andrewaylett/haste-server) to GitHub.  Now
I've got a collaborative environment where I can save what we're working on.
There aren't any sophisticated security controls -- if you know the URL, you
can view the document -- but it took me less time to set up than it did to
write about it afterwards, and I think that's pretty cool :).
