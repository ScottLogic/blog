Presented at [NUX5 in Manchester](https://2016.nuxconf.uk/)

*Graham:* Have you heard of ‘conversational UIs’ or ‘conversational commerce’?<br/>
*You:* Sort of, but I’m not entirely sure what it’s all about…<br/>
*Graham:* It’s the idea of using natural language – you know, chat, messaging, voice and the like – as the way of interacting with brands or services through things like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Siri.<br/>
*Graham:* As a designer it’s kind of exciting and terrifying in equal measures 🙂<br/>
*You:* Sounds a bit space-age!<br/>
*Graham:* No no, it’s actually already here in some forms, and will be properly real fairly soon.<br/>
*Graham:* Come along to my session and I’ll try to explain it all as well as demonstrate some work on this I’ve done around banking.
