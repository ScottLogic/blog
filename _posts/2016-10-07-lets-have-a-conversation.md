Presented at [NUX5 in Manchester](https://2016.nuxconf.uk/)

*Graham:* Have you heard of â€˜conversational UIsâ€™ or â€˜conversational commerceâ€™?<br/>
*You:* Sort of, but Iâ€™m not entirely sure what itâ€™s all aboutâ€¦<br/>
*Graham:* Itâ€™s the idea of using natural language â€“ you know, chat, messaging, voice and the like â€“ as the way of interacting with brands or services through things like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Siri.<br/>
*Graham:* As a designer itâ€™s kind of exciting and terrifying in equal measures ðŸ™‚<br/>
*You:* Sounds a bit space-age!<br/>
*Graham:* No no, itâ€™s actually already here in some forms, and will be properly real fairly soon.<br/>
*Graham:* Come along to my session and Iâ€™ll try to explain it all as well as demonstrate some work on this Iâ€™ve done around banking.
