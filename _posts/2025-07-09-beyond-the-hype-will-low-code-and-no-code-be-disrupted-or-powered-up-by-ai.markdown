In this episode, I'm joined by Ani Allen from OutSystems and Ryan Grey from Marra to discuss the evolving landscape of Low-Code, No-Code, and AI-assisted development. With backgrounds spanning neuroscience, enterprise software, and consultancy, my guests bring a rich mix of perspectives to a conversation that cuts through the hype.\
\
We explore the spectrum from No-Code, through Low-Code, to High- (or Pro-?) Code, and consider how AI is reshaping the development experience. From citizen developers and shadow IT to the promise (and pitfalls) of conversational coding, our discussion highlights both the opportunities and governance challenges that come with democratising software creation.\
\
Whether you're a developer, tech leader, or just curious about the future of building software, this episode offers a grounded look at how Low-Code and AI might transform your digital strategy, if used wisely.
