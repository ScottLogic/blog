<p>I will be presenting as part of the Elevator Pitch session, which consists of an hour of 3-minute talks by different speakers on completely different topics covering the full spectrum from design to coding.  By all accounts the session is always intense but fun and inspirational and it is a wonderful opportunity for new talent to gain some exposure.  My talk is entitled <strong>"How I Learned to Stop Drawing Lines and Love Whitespace"</strong> and I will be posting more details about it closer to the time.</p>
