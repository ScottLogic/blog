In this episode, I'm joined by colleagues Oliver Cronk, Chris Price and James Heward for a lively debate on whether the latest advances in generative AI are going to threaten our jobs – are we going to be made redundant by our own creation?

We start with a quick summary of the latest advances in AI, and consider the nascent reasoning capabilities these models exhibit. We then explore the various tasks and roles required to build software applications, and consider the impact this technology will have.
