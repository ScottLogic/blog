<p>An abstract for my talk is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>WPF and Silverlight: Unifying the Development Platform for Desktop, Web and Mobile with Colin Eberhardt</strong></p>
<p>The recent boom in mobile and tablet devices and the ubiquity of the web mean that we, as software developers, have found ourselves developing for a wide range of devices. All-to-often applications destined for the web, desktop and mobile are developed separately at great cost. This talk will look at how the XAML based technologies of WPF and Silverlight allow you to use your skills to build application for a wide range of platforms. Furthermore, with the use of simple design patterns, it is possible to share a common code-base for all three. In this talk I will cover the differences and similarities of WPF, Silverlight and Windows Phone 7, with a practical demonstration of cross-platform application development.</p>
<p>At this talk I will demonstrating various working examples including XAMLFinance a cross-platform WPF / Silverlight / WP7 application I have been working on:</p>
