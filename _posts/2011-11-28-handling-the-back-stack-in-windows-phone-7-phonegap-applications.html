<p>Recently I have been researching the use of PhoneGap for creating HTML5 Windows Phone 7 applications. I have written an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2011/09/29/developing-windows-phone-7-html5-apps-with-phonegap" title="Developing Windows Phone 7 HTML5 apps with PhoneGap">introductory post</a> on the subject and also managed to have a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2011/11/07/property-finder-the-first-html5-based-windows-phone-7-application" title="Property Finder - the first HTML5-based Windows Phone 7 Application">HTML5-based application accepted into the marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows Phone 7 execution model has a few unique features (when compared to Android and iOS) that need to be considered when developing HTML5 applications. The first one, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2011/10/24/tombstoning-with-phonegap-for-windows-phone-7-and-knockoutjs" title="Tombstoning with PhoneGap for Windows Phone 7 (and KnockoutJS)">tombstoning</a>, is something I dealt with in an earlier blogpost. In this post I want to look at how to handle the back-button and the application back-stack.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2011/11/BackStack.png" alt="" title="BackStack" width="600" height="279" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1853" /></p>
<p>With Windows Phone 7, as the user navigates from one page to the next, the latest page is added to the top of a stack (the back-stack). The back-button is used to navigate back through the pages within your application by pulling them from the top of this stack. When the back stack holds a single page, i.e. the initial entry point into your application, pressing the back-button should exit the application.</p>
<p>So, how do you support this with a HTML5 / PhoneGap application? The PhoneGap APIs expose the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.0.0/phonegap_events_events.md.html#backbutton">back-button as a JavaScript event</a>. If you subscribe to this event, your JavaScript code is notified each time the user hits the back button. Also, if the JavaScript event is subscribed to, the 'native' (C#) event is cancelled, which means application back-stack remains unchanged and your PhoneGap application does not exit.</p>
<p>In order to emulate the back-stack functionality in a PhoneGap application you need to subscribe to the PhoneGap backbutton when back-navigation is possible within your application, and unsubscribe when it is not. This means that when the user hits the back-button at the entry-point of your application, the application is terminated as expected.</p>
<h2>A JavaScript Back-Stack</h2>
<p>In order to handle the PhoenGap backbutton event, I felt the easiest approach would be to structure my JavaScript application so that it more closely resembles a Windows Phone 7 application. I have already discussed in my blog post on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2011/10/24/tombstoning-with-phonegap-for-windows-phone-7-and-knockoutjs" title="Tombstoning with PhoneGap for Windows Phone 7 (and KnockoutJS)">tombstoning how this task was made easier by using KnockoutJS</a> to structure my code using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.</p>
<p>In this blog I'll add further structure to the code, starting with an <code>ApplicationViewModel</code>. This view model contains a stack of view-models, with the one that is at the top of the stack, exposed via the <code>currentViewModel</code> observable property, being the one which is rendered on screen. The ApplicationViewModel also exposes functions for adding to and removing items from this stack:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
function ApplicationViewModel() {

  var that = this;

  this.viewModelBackStack = ko.observableArray();

  this.backButtonRequired = ko.dependentObservable(function () {
    return this.viewModelBackStack().length > 1;
  }, this);

  this.currentViewModel = ko.dependentObservable(function () {
    return this.viewModelBackStack()[this.viewModelBackStack().length-1];
  }, this);

  this.navigateTo = function (viewModel) {
    this.viewModelBackStack.push(viewModel);
  }

  this.back = function () {
    this.viewModelBackStack.pop();
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The <code>currentViewModel</code> is implemented as a <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/dependentObservables.html">dependent-observable</a>, a really neat KnockoutJS feature where you create a new observable property based on one or more observable properties of a view model. In this case, KnockoutJS does some magic behind the scenes to deduce that <code>currentViewModel</code> depends upon the <code>viewModelBackStack</code> observable array. Each time the array is modified, bindings that depend on <code>currentViewModel</code> are also updated. That's pretty neat!</p>
<p>The UI code needs to be modified so that the view relating to the <code>currentViewModel</code> is rendered and bound to its respective view model. This is simply a matter of subscribing to changes in this observable property in our code:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
// create the view model
application = new ApplicationViewModel();

application.currentViewModel.subscribe(function (viewModel) {
  if (viewModel !== undefined) {
    $("#app").empty();
    $("#" + viewModel.template).tmpl("").appendTo("#app");
    ko.applyBindings(viewModel);
  }
});

application.navigateTo(new TwitterSearchViewModel());
{% endhighlight %}
<p>For the above code to work, each view model must expose a <code>template</code> property which identified the HTML template which is their corresponding view. The above code creates a view instance and appends it to the <code>#app</code> element.</p>
<p>The templates for the two view-models within this application are shown below:</p>
{% highlight html %}
<script type=text/x-jquery-tmpl" charset="utf-8" id="twitterSearchView">
  <div>
    <form data-bind="submit: search">
        <input data-bind="value: searchTerm, valueUpdate: 'afterkeydown'" />
        <button type="submit" data-bind="enable: searchTerm().length > 0 && isSearching() == false">Go</button>
    </form>
    <ul data-bind="template: {name: 'tweetView', foreach: tweets}"> </ul>
  </div>
</script>

<script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" charset="utf-8" id="tweetView">
  <li class="tweet"
    data-bind="click: select">
    <div class="thumbnailColumn">
      <img data-bind="attr: { src: thumbnail }" class="thumbnail"/>
    </div>
    <div class="detailsColumn">
      <div class="author" data-bind="text: author"/>
      <div class="text" data-bind="text: text"/>
      <div class="time" data-bind="text: time"/>
    </div>
  </li>
</script>

<script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" charset="utf-8" id="tweetDetailView">
  <div class="tweet">
    <div class="thumbnailColumn">
      <img data-bind="attr: { src: thumbnail }" class="thumbnail"/>
    </div>
    <div class="detailsColumn">
      <div class="author" data-bind="text: author"/>
      <div class="text" data-bind="text: text"/>
      <div class="time" data-bind="text: time"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</script>

<h1 id="welcomeMsg">Twitter Search</h1>
<div id="app" />
{% endhighlight %}
<p>When a tweet is clicked on, the <code>select </code>function is invoked via the Knockout binding. This simply pushes a <code>TweetViewModel</code> instance onto the application stack:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
this.select = function () {
  application.navigateTo(this);
};
{% endhighlight %}
<h2>Handling the Back-Button</h2>
<p>The above code navigates to the given view model, this will cause the <code>currentViewModel</code> dependent observable to notify that a change has occurred and the view that relates to this view model will be rendered. The next step is to wire up the back-button.</p>
<p>The <code>ApplicationViewModel</code> has a boolean <code>backButtonRequired</code> dependent observable that indicates whether the JavaScript code needs to handle the back-button. This is true whenever there is more than one item in the back-stack:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
this.backButtonRequired = ko.dependentObservable(function () {
  return this.viewModelBackStack().length > 1;
}, this);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>When the application is initially created, we handle changes to the observable as follows:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
application.backButtonRequired.subscribe(function (backButtonRequired) {
  if (backButtonRequired) {
    document.addEventListener("backbutton", onBackButton, false);
  } else {
    document.removeEventListener("backbutton", onBackButton, false);
  }
});

function onBackButton() {
  application.back();
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And that's it! When the JavaScript back-stack has more than one item, the PhoneGap <code>backbutton</code> event is handled and the <code>back</code> function invoked on our application, popping the top item from the stack, with the view updating accordingly. When our JavaScript back-stack has a single item, we no longer handle the PhoneGap <code>backbutton</code> event, this results in the Silverlight container handling the back-button. The Silverlight application back-stack always has a single page, so our application will exit.</p>
<p>This technique for handling the back-stack is simple and elegant, this example has just two simple pages, however this same pattern should scale well for more complex HTML5 applications.</p>
