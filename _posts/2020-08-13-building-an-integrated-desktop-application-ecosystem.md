### A guide to the tools, products and migration challenges
This paper identifies the core building blocks that are required to build an integrated desktop application ecosystem using a combination of web and legacy technologies – an ecosystem where it is easier to deploy and integrate both your own applications and those from third-party vendors. We look at the challenges involved in moving from legacy desktop technologies to the fast-moving world of web technologies. And finally, we review the various open source and commercial products that form the building blocks of this ecosystem of the future.
