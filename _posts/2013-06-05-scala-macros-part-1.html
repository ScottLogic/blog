summary: Diving in head first into Scala Macros, generating code using the language's
  abstract syntax tree. I'll be looking at how to create a function that in subsequent
  articles we can turn into a generated RESTful API.

<em>This article was originally posted on <a href="http://garbage-collection.potes.org.uk/2013/03/adventures-with-scala-macros-part-1.html">my own blog</a> but is cross posted here, where
the subsequent articles in the series will appear.</em><br />
<br />
With the arrival of Scala 2.10 came two interesting new features: the <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/overview.html">reflection API</a> and <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html">macros</a>. The possibilities for macros are many, and one that I want to explore is how you can use a macro to create a Play Framework REST API from a data model represented as a set of case classes. In this and subsequent articles I'll be using a simple book store type application with case classes for <tt>Book</tt>, <tt>Author</tt> and <tt>Category</tt> in the <tt>model</tt> package.<br />
<br />
Normally in the Play Framework you'd declare your rest API in the <tt>routes</tt> file, something like:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=routes"></script>
<br />
However, as you can't use custom Scala in <tt>routes</tt> (since Play 2.0, anyway), we'll be designing a macro for use in the <tt>onRouteRequest</tt> function of the <tt>Global</tt> object that extends the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/api/2.0/scala/play/api/GlobalSettings.html" target="_blank"><tt>GlobalSettings</tt></a>&nbsp;trait. This function takes a request and returns an Action. The selection of what Action to return will be based on the URL, so we'll have to match the path to the right case class.<br />
<br />
In this first article, we'll be working out how to do that matching based on an unknown number of case classes in the application's model.<br />
<br />
If we weren't using a macro, we'd probably do something like:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=non-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
Our macro will need to generate the same function by iterating over all the found case classes. Firstly we need to declare the macro, and then complete the implementation, as follows:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=macro-signature.scala"></script>
<br />
What we've done here is declare a macro as described on the documentation linked above. The macro context's universe is imported - it is important to make sure you import the universe exactly as above, as if you use an import like <tt>c.{universe =&gt; u}</tt> then for some reason erasure stops them working properly. We've then used the universe's <tt>reify</tt> function to return an expression for <tt>Some("TODO")</tt> - the <tt>reify</tt> function basically turns the enclosed scala into an AST tree expression.<br />
<br />
Finally, we need a unit test to check we've implemented the method correctly:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=unit-test.scala"></script>
<br />
The <tt>caseUsingMacro</tt> function will have its body replaced with the result of macro call - i.e. it is here that the function is going to be generated, replacing <tt>Macro.macroCase(s)</tt>.<br />
<br />
Now we're ready to start implementing the <tt>macroCaseImpl</tt> function from above - but what do we need to return, and how can we debug our macro's output to see how we're doing. Fortunately, there are two very useful functions in the universe - <tt>show</tt> and <tt>showRaw</tt>. Given an AST tree, the <tt>show</tt> function will return a pretty-formatted string of the equivalent scala code. The <tt>showRaw</tt> function will return a string of the AST making up the tree. As what we're trying to implement is something that for our 3 case classes will look like the <tt>caseStmt</tt> function above, we can get a good hint for what we need to end up with to look at its equivalent AST, which we can get by doing:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=showing-raw.scala"></script>
<br />
The results of this <tt>println</tt> will be output to the console for the compilation <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-return">[1]</a></sup>. We get something like this:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=raw-ast.scala"></script>
<br />
We'll break this apart into useful fragments as we get to using them.<br />
<br />
So, first we need to get a list of all the case classes in the model package. To do this, we can iterate over the context's <tt>enclosingRun.units</tt> property, matching on elements of the AST tree for each compilation unit to find out the package name, and then checking that we've got a case class. The rough code we need for this is:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=filter-compunits.scala"></script>
<br />
We then need to implement the <tt>packageFinder</tt> and <tt>classFinder</tt> functions. To check that the compilation unit is in the desired package, the first of these needs to return true when the <tt>Tree</tt> instance is a <tt>PackageDef</tt> with a name equal to, or starting with, the second argument, so:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=package-finder.scala"></script>
<br />
Then to check that the compilation unit contains a case class, the second function needs to return true if the <tt>Tree</tt> instance is a <tt>ClassDef</tt> with a <tt>CASE</tt>  modifier:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=class-finder.scala"></script>
<br />
So now we've got a list (well, in fact it's an <tt>Iterator</tt>) of the case class compilation units in the package we need to turn them into regular expressions to match against the URL, and into case statements to do the matching.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the regular expressions. If we take the AST that we generated above, we can see that the value definition for one regex is:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=regex-ast.scala"></script>
<br />
Of the four parameters to the <tt>ValDef</tt> creator, the first, <tt>Modifiers()</tt>, and third, <tt>TypeTree()</tt>, we can take straight into our generated AST. The second parameter we can generate using a context function to create a new unique val name, <tt>c.fresh("regex$")</tt>. The last parameter is using the implicit <tt>augmentString</tt> function on a <tt>String</tt> so that we can then call the <tt>r</tt> function to turn it into a <tt>Regex</tt>. However, we can do this more simply using the <tt>reify</tt> function combined with a string expression for the regex we want to use, which we can construct in the macro using the class name:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=regex-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
Here we've created an <tt>Expr</tt> object of a constant that is the regex string, and then used the splice function, which is a special function that allows an <tt>Expr</tt> object to be grafted into the middle of the block being reified. We then just call the <tt>r</tt> function inside the <tt>reify</tt> block for it to be turned into a <tt>Regex</tt>.<br />
<br />
The other bit of AST that we need to generate for each class name is the case statement of the match block. Again, from the above, we can see that this should look something like:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=case-ast.scala"></script>
<br />
Reformatting, this becomes a little easier to understand:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=case-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
Notice that again we've swapped the <tt>newTermName("bookRegex")</tt> for <tt>valName</tt> which is the fresh name we got using the <tt>"regex$"</tt> base name, the name of the defined value that is the <tt>Regex</tt>.<br />
<br />
Now, we need to collect up all the <tt>val</tt> definitions and case statements so that they can be assembled into a block of scala code. We also need to add the default case:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=default-case.scala"></script>
<br />
Putting all this together, and getting the class name from the AST tree for the compilation unit, we get:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=regexes-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
So, we assemble the cases and regexes into a block. The return of the block is going to be the result of the match statement, and the regexes are declared before that final statement, so (remember, s is the original parameter to the macroCaseImpl function):<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=block-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
To check that this AST tree really is the Scala code we hope it is, we can use the show function I mentioned before:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=show-generated.scala"></script>
<br />
And finally, we return the Expr that contains our block of scala:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=final-macro.scala"></script>
<br />
And when we compile, we see that our Block tree is equivalent to:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mrpotes/678c1918e1c637da1f7a.js?file=generated-code.scala"></script>
<br />
Here we can see the generated <tt>val</tt> names and the familiar regexes and match-case block returning the Option values that are expected. On running the unit test, we find it now passes.<br />
<br />
Phew!<br />
<br />
In <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url jphillpotts/2013-06-06-scala-macros-part-2 %}">the next stage of this adventure</a>, I'll be extending this to use persistence of case classes as declared in their companion object, and deducing what REST operations are available based on what data access functions are exposed.<br />

<a href="#footnote-1-return" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> If you're using the Scala IDE it might take you a while to find the compilation output - what you need to do is turn up the logging to DEBUG in Window -&gt; Preferences, Scala -&gt; Logging. Your console output will then appear in [workspace]/.metadata/.plugins/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/scala-ide.log
