The challenge with DevOps adoption is that it is not a single event; it is a cultural change that needs to be fostered and supported.
 
In this webinar, Bartosz Jedrzejewski shares his experience and advice on practical actions that people at different levels can take to increase their chance of DevOps success. 

Bartosz discusses how DevOps culture can manifest itself differently in different companies and dismisses the “one-size-fits-all” approach. He looks at different initiatives taken by a variety of companies that have resulted in many success stories. And he looks at how DevOps is likely to change in 2020 and beyond.
