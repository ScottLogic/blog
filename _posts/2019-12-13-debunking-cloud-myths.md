Enticed by the initial promise of what the cloud has to offer, many companies find themselves confronted with significant blockers to pursuing a cloud migration – whether in the form of security concerns, unexpectedly high migration costs, or some other impediment to making a successful business case.

In this webinar, Technical Architect James Dunkerley provides a balanced and clear-eyed view of the pros and cons of migrating to the cloud in relation to four key factors – agility, cost, security, and vendor lock-in. He debunks both the cloud hype and the cloud scepticism, giving you a clearer sense of the true benefits of the cloud and the questions your business needs to ask itself when considering cloud migration.
