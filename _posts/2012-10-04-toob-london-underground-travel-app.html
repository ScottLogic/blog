summary: Toob is a London Underground travel app for Windows 8 that I am designing
  and developing for CodeProject's App Innovation Contest.  It is currently a work
  in progress but I have written an article introducing the application and going
  through some useful technical information for anyone interested in writing HTML5
  applications for Windows 8.

<p>I have recently been working on an application called Toob as an entry for <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject's</a> App Innovation Contest.  It is a London Underground travel app for Windows 8 that will be released to the Windows Store in due course.  It is currently a work in progress but I have written an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/ArticleVersion.aspx?waid=40124&aid=470645" target="_blank">article</a> introducing the application and going through some useful technical information for anyone interested in writing HTML5 applications for Windows 8.  It is primarily a technical article, but I plan to write up some thoughts about the Windows 8 user experience and designing for Windows 8 in due course.  For those of you who can't wait, here is a sneak preview of my opinion: the Windows 8 user experience is as Frankenstein-ish as you'd expect from its dual-experience nature; it is both truly delightful and painfully awkward.</p>
