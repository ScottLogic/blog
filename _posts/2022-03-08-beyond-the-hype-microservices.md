summary: Microservices have become the standard architectural pattern for everything.
  It’s a great and versatile pattern, but what people rarely talk about is the cost.
  You didn’t think you got all that good stuff (polyglot, scalable, decoupled...)
  for free, did you? In this episode, we talk about the real-world impact of choosing
  this pattern and when it might not be the right choice.

Beyond the Hype is a new monthly podcast from the Scott Logic team, where we cast a practical eye over what is new and exciting in technology – everything from Kafka to Kubernetes, AI to APIs, microservices to micro-frontends. We look beyond the promises, the buzz and excitement to guide you towards the genuine value.

Microservices have become the standard architectural pattern for everything. It’s a great and versatile pattern, but what people rarely talk about is the cost. You didn’t think you got all that good stuff (polyglot, scalable, decoupled...) for free, did you? In this episode, we talk about the real-world impact of choosing this pattern and when it might not be the right choice.
