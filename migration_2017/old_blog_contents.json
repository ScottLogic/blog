I attended the conference along with my fellow graduate developers Chris and Nikos, and as it was our first time at such a large developer conference, there was a lot to take in.</p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the bar is set</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day started with Simon Ritter giving a keynote on whether an Agile standard is possible for Java. It included an interesting history lesson on how Java got to the point it\u2019s at today and how it might, in the future, evolve into a more Agile way of releasing new features using JDK* Enhancement Proposals (JEPs*). The audience reacted with some friction, as although it means developers will get access to new features more frequently, it also adds bureaucracy to the development process. \u201cAre we going to switch to the next point update for this single feature or not?\u201d is likely to become a frequently asked question in meetings, which could noticeably slow down the Agile process for developers. </span></p><p>It seemed most of the audience were happy with the current release frequency of JDK updates. Tools for developers should have some in-built stability, so unless the JCP* creates a safe and stable environment to release JEPs, it will probably be detrimental for most developers with larger, longer running projects.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the initial keynote, Chris and I went to see Lucas Fernandes da Costa\u2019s presentation on Meta Programming in JavaScript, which focused on the inner workings of JavaScript. Given that our time so far at Scott Logic has predominantly focused on this language, this talk was extremely beneficial. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucas provided us with a detailed illustration of how to improve performance through overriding the standard properties of objects such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">getter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> methods. The demonstration focused on adding properties to the object which served as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flags</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to prepare the object for the subsequent operation.</span></p><p>An example of this is:</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cbasket.add(10).apples\u201d - \u00a0where the add flag prepares the operation, which is actually performed for a specific property (apples) when that property is called (here the internal </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">method is overridden, hence the lack of function parentheses). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This creates a chain of function calls that is very readable and logical to understand; the same technique is employed in the Chai testing library, of which Lucas is a core maintainer. Beyond this, we were shown how to use this approach to emulate the powerful features of other languages, such as Haskell\u2019s lazy properties and infinite sequences. Overall this provided us with a strong insight into the depth and possibilities of a language we are all still relatively new to.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The star of the show</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that we went to see our colleague Dan, who had an interesting presentation on high velocity streaming. He talked about the problems he ran into using traditional processing methods (eg collect window of data -&gt; ingest it -&gt; save it -&gt; compute values from it and then send the user a signal). </span></p><p>This way the signal is always delayed until the next computation period, usually at the end of a measurement, meaning if you have a four-hour period, the signal you might want immediately could be delayed by four hours. You could make the periods smaller but when you want real time response, it\u2019s simply not feasible to do it the traditional way. Dan showed us the way forward using a combination of Kafka (a message broker) and Apache Spark (a processing engine). He showed us how the data is safe, even when a sensor or subnetwork fails, and how it can scale to Internet of Things (IoT) proportions if you switch Apache Spark to Apache Flint.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After some lunch, we went to see the colourful Szymon Warda for an introduction to graph databases. He showed us how they can greatly reduce complexity in relational databases, which allows great improvements to be found in computation time. Of course, this allows more processing to be done in the same time frame, which can lead to finding new patterns in Big Data. From this he taught us how to suggest products to customers and build a knowledge database.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following that we went to see IBM Software Engineer Adam Pilkington to learn about getting microservices up and running in no time through a tutorial. For this purpose, IBM has set up a text adventure game, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GameOn,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is written as a collection of microservices. Users can navigate in a map of rooms, as well as deploy rooms, connecting their own service to the larger system that comprises GameOn. Using the microservices approach, the user is enabled to try implementing a feature with various technologies almost seamlessly, as they\u2019re independent modules. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GameOn</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now has an immense number of diverse rooms and loads of learning fun.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, it was on to more managerial tasks with Adaptavist CTO Dan Hardiker. His presentation, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Retrospective on Retrospectives</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, taught us the value of being able to voice your concerns to your peers and superiors, and touched upon how the enablers of teams could be more valuable than the superstars; a principle that seems reasonably straightforward, but needs to be repeated out loud every now and then.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, we were introduced to many (maybe even too many?) new concepts and ideas and it piqued our curiosity and eagerness to learn even more. Voxxed Days 2017 was a pleasant eye opener to what\u2019s happening in the industry, and to what awaits us further down the path of our careers. We hope to be able to continue to be part of events like this in the future.</span></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*JDK - Java Development Kit</span></em></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*JEP - Java Enhancements</span></em></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*JCP - Java Community Process</span></em></p>"},

Here\u2019s a taste of what she gets up to.</span></em><br><br></p><p><!--more-->Recently, I went along to Mortimer Community College in South Shields to talk about my job in front of a small group of 10-11 year olds, and to do some hands-on problem solving tasks with them. At the end of the session the teacher told me she was surprised to hear there are so many different routes \u00a0to get a job in software engineering; she thought it was a clear-cut path - \u00a0i.e. you had to study software development, or computer science, at university. This simply confirmed to me the reason that I was there; to inform students, and teachers alike, that there are many different ways to get into software engineering, and there are different roles within it.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took quite an odd route into software; I did animation at university and worked in the gaming industry before joining Scott Logic. The look of surprise on the Year 9 and 10 students faces at Hebburn Comprehensive, which I also visited recently, at the fact I\u2019d done animation and not a software-based degree, yet still worked in software was amusing but saddening at the same time. Some part of society has failed to inform these bright young minds that your path through life is not clear-cut: it\u2019s an intricate web of choices and opportunities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been getting involved with a few STEM Ambassador activities with this goal in mind; to show students and teachers that a career in software can be reached from many different paths through different types of education. This is likely to become even more the case as the industry moves so fast. For example, the students were wowed when I told them about the first computer (the Difference Engine by Charles Babbage), which stood at a gaping 11ft wide and 8ft tall, and the first commercial computer UNIVAC 1, which cost $1.5million to buy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different skills and personalities can lend different outlooks to problem solving; if all people building software were from the same background, all software may end up the same and we wouldn\u2019t be building and innovating new things. This is especially true for the role of a software tester, as we want people with different backgrounds who can bring different skills, opinions and ideas to the table. I want to show young students that your degree doesn\u2019t define your life. If you make the \u2018wrong\u2019 decision, you can still take actions later in life to get on the path you want to be on. And quite often, that \u2018wrong\u2019 decision can be what makes you an interesting and good choice for employers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STEM Ambassadors event at Hebburn Comprehensive was also a part of NWED (National Women in Engineering Day), in an attempt to encourage more girls to choose STEM subjects at A level and beyond. By informing them of influential historical women (like Ada Lovelace) and also chatting to them about our own job roles, we hoped that we could interest a few of the students in a STEM path. I am very conscious of the low ratio of women to men in STEM roles, and even though we don\u2019t know exactly why, I think it is important to do what we can to help young women to realise their potential in a STEM career.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that I can use my unusual (and apparently interesting!) background to help students either realise that choosing a STEM degree is the easiest path into a STEM job, or show that your degree choice is not the be all and end all. STEM Ambassadors is a great place to help inform the younger generations of their options that they might not get otherwise.

But there is something of an elephant in the room when it comes to the tech industry - the lack of women entering STEM roles, not just in the UK but worldwide.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s widely recognised that </span><a href=\"http://techcitynews.com/2017/02/15/heres-how-we-can-solve-techs-diversity-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recruiting a diverse workforce inclusive of women creates a more creative and innovative environment in which to work</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And well known travel brand Airbnb has vowed to increase its number of technical women to 25 per cent in 2017, but are all tech businesses taking this approach?</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it so difficult to encourage women into STEM roles?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government Equalities Office said in its 2016 report </span><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500087/Government_response_-_Closing_the_Gender_Pay_Gap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the gender pay gap</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: \u201cGendered stereotypes about what society regards as \u2018men\u2019s work\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 are a strong influence on young people throughout their education, and can have a significant influence on the career choices they make.\u201d</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the issue clearly can\u2019t be blamed on one single organisation or institution. It\u2019s plain to see that to solve the diversity skills gap, educators, businesses, and campaigners need to come together. Tech innovators and big brands such as Airbnb and Facebook are championing women in STEM, which is leading others to follow in their direction. Unless we work together to encourage more women into STEM, it will constantly be a disjointed process, meaning more women are likely to miss out on reaching their potential in a huge range of fantastic careers.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing our bit</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business, we are committed to equal opportunity, so are proud to have more than doubled the number of women in technical roles at our Bristol office over the <a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/beingboldforchange-international-womens-day/\" target=\"_blank\">last 12 months</a>.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While encouraging women into STEM is something we work to do across Scott Logic, in Bristol we also support the Women\u2019s Tech Hub, a network organisation committed to addressing this issue, and we also plan to host a Girl Geek Dinner later this year for the second time. Outside of Bristol, we\u2019re also a long-time sponsor of the Lovelace Colloquium, a one-day conference for female STEM students, which this year is celebrating its 10th anniversary. And in Newcastle, we have our very own STEM Ambassador, Hannah, who is passionate about encouraging women and girls into STEM, attending events and taking part in initiatives at local schools and meetups to help the word.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott Logic\u2019s Head of Development in Bristol, Nic Hemley, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic to see that our efforts to encourage and support women in STEM can actually make a difference. Whilst we recognise there is still far more for us to do to raise awareness of the gender imbalance in UK technology, we\u2019re incredibly proud to have seen an increase in the numbers of talented women contributing to Scott Logic\u2019s success, not just in Bristol but also nationwide. We hope to build on this momentum and employ many more women over the coming months and years\u201d</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose tinted glasses</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although pleased with our progress to attract a greater number of women into our technical roles, this doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t work to be done. It\u2019s evident from </span><a href=\"https://www.manchesterdigital.com/sites/default/files/Skills%20Audit%20Report%202017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manchester Digital\u2019s Annual Digital Skills Audit 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the gender gap is definitely still apparent in tech, with a split of 72:28 male to female in the northern technology sector compared to 60:40 in 2016.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a company, we\u2019ll continue to work with meetup groups, schools, and other organisations, to increase awareness of the variety of roles there are in STEM for women and girls to consider. By working together with educators, campaigners and organisations, we will hopefully and gradually be able to tackle this issue. However, it\u2019s an ongoing, long-term process that won\u2019t bring about change overnight.

As bots are a new field, it was a good challenge for the interns and a great opportunity for them to try out new tools and APIs. The project was organised with a similar structure to a real world project, with weekly sprints, a product owner providing requirements, and daily stand-ups. It gave the interns an insight into how projects are run at Scott Logic, and our colleagues successfully got their sandwiches when the bot had its first run!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=522&amp;height=272&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png\" alt=\"bacon_sarnie_bot.png\" width=\"522\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=261&amp;height=136&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 261w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=522&amp;height=272&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 522w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=783&amp;height=408&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 783w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1044&amp;height=544&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 1044w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1305&amp;height=680&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 1305w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bacon_sarnie_bot.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1566&amp;height=816&amp;name=bacon_sarnie_bot.png 1566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\"></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color: #c41565;\"><strong>Jade, University of York</strong></span></p><p>As a Maths student with no experience with code, I\u2019d never considered a career in software testing; prior to my internship, my exposure had been limited to a module in Java in my second year. When I saw Scott Logic\u2019s 12-week internship it looked like too much of a good\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity to miss.</span></p><p>From the first day I joined, Scott Logic provided me with the help and tools I needed to learn, apply my skills and develop throughout the summer. During my first couple of weeks, I started using the online Code Academy JavaScript training and then moved onto some HTML5 training materials developed by Scott Logic, while also familiarising myself with the technologies and frameworks I was going to be using over the next three months. After two weeks of training, my skills were put to the test as we started on our main project of the summer - creating a bot for the office.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing the bot was tricky as there has been very little work in this field before. We had to create a second bot which \u201ctalked\u201d to our bot, simulating real conversations. It was a good challenge and allowed me to learn a lot about both development, as well as testing with tools such as Jasmine.</span><br></span></p><p><span style=\"color: #c41565;\"><strong>Martin, Durham University</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interning here has given me a great insight into working in a real Agile team with modern technologies.

Initially this was daunting, as I had only written around 10 lines of JavaScript before starting the project. I also gained experience with technologies such as Docker, NGINX and Facebook's ReactJS library.

This year, we opted for an implementation of Channel 4\u2019s Countdown. The app was developed using the popular ReactJS library, supported by modern development tools and processes, such as on many of our real client projects. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although our project domain was light-hearted, the delivery process was professional as we wanted to give the interns a taste of life in the real world, customers and all.

In this post, fellow Test Engineer Hannah delves a little deeper into this misconception and things we can do to dispel it.</span></i></p><p><!--more--></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, six testers from around the world got together on a video call and talked about selection issues in testing. I mostly listened, with it being my first </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday Night Testing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and being so awed and fascinated by the experience and knowledge of the people talking. There was one issue that we covered that I feel pretty strongly about; the topic of how to rectify the perception that testing is boring. I did chime in for that one, and was subsequently encouraged to blog about my experiences. I find this topic very interesting as I've been lucky enough to work at places where testing was generally kept interesting and fresh, but I know that a lot of people have this misconception.</span></p><p>In this blog I don't want to discuss \u2018why\u2019 people perceive testing as boring (that's a whole other blog post!), but rather what can we do to dispel this myth. In this blog I'm going to share what I've personally been involved with, to help spread the word that actually, testing is fun!</p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starting at the beginning</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing that I got involved with was the STEM Ambassadors, which is all about encouraging children and teens, from primary school to sixth form to choose STEM subjects or careers. For some of the activities I signed up to help with, I had a chance to chat about my job and my experience. It was rewarding to see people who had never heard of testing before have a chance to learn about and question it. I'd like to think that at least one person has gone home with the words <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software Tester</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in mind and will consider it as a future path.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharing experience</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second thing that I\u2019ve been involved with is career mentoring at Newcastle University. I was partnered with a second year student from a Computer Science course who had a keen passion for testing. Our first session was simply getting to know each other and figuring out what she wanted out of the mentoring time. For the sessions after that, I encouraged her to read about certain topics, and then we would discuss what she had learnt and what she was interested in. I also brought in my laptop with some buggy software and showed her how I would test, getting her to explore the software as well. I think guiding and showing someone who has an interest in testing is a great thing to do. So few people have the chance to even talk to someone about what testing is before they decide on their career path. I would encourage anyone to get in touch with their local university and see if there are any similar opportunities.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talks</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of November fellow Tester Jack and myself gave a talk at Newcastle University - instead of just telling the students what testing was, we told stories of our real world experiences with testing. Hopefully hearing what testing is actually like in a real scenario will have interested a few people who perhaps aren't set on a developer role in the future.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we can all help!</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If people don't know about testing, or all they\u2019ve heard of testing is what they've learnt at university, then how can they know how to pursue it as a career? We have a fantastic community of software testing professionals out there, and we have the experience, knowledge and passion to inspire others to learn more about testing. There are so many opportunities out there for us to get involved and teach. I hope through reading this blog that some of you are inspired to inspire others: through STEM Ambassadors, presentations, mentoring, or any other opportunity you can find. Perhaps one day testing will be a career that people consider long before they enter the working world. We can start by informing people about testing. We can start by creating opportunities. We can destroy the myth one step at a time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're interested in starting a career in testing why not take a look at our <span style=\"color: #c41565;\"><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/vacancies/graduate-software-tester/\" style=\"color: #c41565;\">Graduate Software Tester Programme</a>.</span></span></p>"},

There are some interesting differences between working for a company that provides in-house development and working as a Scott Logic consultant.</span></p><p>There are of course the obvious differences between the two, which may depend on the company that you\u2019re comparing consulting with. For a start, consulting is a client-facing job, where you\u2019ll be dealing with people outside your company on a daily basis. That changes a few things. Commercial knowledge becomes more relevant, as you may be pulled into a commercial conversation with clients. This of course increases with the level of seniority you operate at within a consultancy.</p><p>Being client facing means there are higher requirements for diplomacy and communication, less crucial in an in-house position. Another obvious difference is the level of change and adaptation required from consultants. You may need to change your technical stack completely when moving between projects. I believe this helps to stay at the cutting edge of technology.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However there are some differences between these two areas that are not immediately obvious when looking from the outside in. When it comes to job satisfaction, there are a number of other areas to look at , such as motivation. I follow the ideas of </span><a href=\"http://www.danpink.com/books/drive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel H. Pink\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drive</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a fascinating book about motivation and job satisfaction. The author argues that what matters most are autonomy, mastery and purpose. So, let\u2019s see how consulting and in-house development compare in these categories.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">autonomy</span></h2><p>Autonomy, or our desire to be self-directed. The more autonomy we have in the workplace, the more engaged we usually are. We want to be able to complete tasks in the way we think best. This, I believe, is especially true for software developers!</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do working in-house and autonomy go well together? There are a few sides to this story. On one hand, being </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the inside</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could mean you\u2019re watched less closely, but it may also mean you\u2019re required to do things the way they\u2019ve always been done in your company. You may be lucky and be able to choose your own projects and products, but more often than not, you\u2019ll specialise in a specific product or area. You're more likely to be limited to specific technologies that are already in use.</span></p><p>I feel I\u2019ve gained autonomy as a Scott Logic consultant. Working for a consultancy gives you opportunities to work on different projects and technologies, while keeping the same job and staying on your career track. You\u2019re able to try different things and Scott Logic always looks for a good fit between what someone wants to do and what projects are available.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you become more experienced as a software consultant you\u2019re often brought in as an expert, to lead and establish best practice and processes. It\u2019s a fantastic feeling not only to have that autonomy, but also to see the positive impact it can bring. Of course, nothing is black and white and consulting also has its challenges. Sometimes you need to win trust from the client before you are given that autonomy, but I see that as a welcome challenge.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastery</span></h2><p>Mastery is the urge to continuously improve your skills. It\u2019s also the area in which I believe consulting has the greatest advantage over in-house development. Rather than working on a product, when working in consultancy, the product is you - the developer! This really changes the company's approach to investing in its people and encouraging learning.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Scott Logic, the most important </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the quality, skill and knowledge of its consultants, and I find it inspiring to be surrounded by like-minded developers, from graduate level right up to our CTO, genuinely dedicated to constantly learning and getting better at what they do, as well as sharing their knowledge and helping others along the way.</span></span></p><h2>purpose</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purpose is the desire to do something that matters. When you go to work, you want to make a positive impact and see that what you do makes a difference. And making a positive difference by delivering a product used by thousands can feel pretty amazing. But unless you\u2019re working for a great start-up, or a company that constantly keeps disrupting the market with a new idea, a high-end consulting company compares quite favourably here! </span></p><p>In my experience, the kind of projects Scott Logic is involved in are crucial to the client; so it\u2019s important to get the best people they can, to deliver the project well and potentially introduce something new to the company. In these circumstances, it\u2019s easy to see that your work is meaningful and makes a positive impact.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to client work, many of us consultants find time to volunteer to teach code through </span><a href=\"https://www.codeclub.org.uk/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Code Club</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other similar charity organisations.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career prospects and progression</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something I\u2019ve found interesting and quite different from the technologists\u2019 average experience in a product company, where you have to really work to not be seen as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just a developer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Being promoted is hard in this environment, and stepping outside the traditional development role can be very difficult. At Scott Logic though, technical excellence, together with consulting experience, is a mix that can take you anywhere in your career. </span></p><p>Many people at the top of their careers are still highly technical and help run the company. You can be a software development consultant and go on to become a client manager, a head of user experience, run a whole office as head of development or even become a CTO! There seems to be no limit to where you can end up if you start as a consultant!</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum up, it\u2019s important to remember there are no two identical companies. When it comes to being an in-house developer in a product company, you may have had very different experiences to me. But I want to highlight the fact that consulting offers a fascinating alternative, where you can really feel like you\u2019re in the driving seat, taking your career further. When you\u2019re gaining more skills and encouraged to take more responsibility on client projects, and the goals of the company are closely aligned with your own, it can only lead to great things!</span></span></p>"},

Since then we have been in discussions with Newcastle University and arranged a bug hunt event on 18th March, in collaboration with the Newcastle University Computing and Technology Society.</p><p>The aim was to create a fun experience that would be worthwhile for organisers and attendees alike, as well as to raise awareness of software testing as a career and what it entails.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often used as a means of including the wider software team in testing, a bugathon is typically a time-boxed activity in which all team members use whatever means they can think of to find bugs in developed software. By encouraging the wider team to participate, it means the software under scrutiny is exercised by people with a more diverse range of skills, perspectives and experience. This means bugs are more likely to be uncovered that otherwise may not have been found until the system was released into production.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decision,decisions</span></h2><p>As we were creating a bespoke bugathon we were able to inject bugs into the system, purposefully making some more challenging to find. Also, given the bug hunt will be relatively short, we wanted something that would be familiar to attendees, that wouldn\u2019t require hours of briefing to set the context.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After some internal discussion, we settled on \u00a0(we want to keep an element of surprise, so you will find out more about the solution on the day). We selected technologies that presented our developers with valuable experience for future client-focused projects. From my perspective, and also the other developers involved, this has been an interesting piece of work; when you\u2019ve spent most of your career trying to make user friendly applications which provide useful outcomes for the user, purposefully doing the opposite does not come easy. </span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expect the unexpected</span></h2><p>As well as trying to keep track of the bugs which we wanted to insert, when making the app we found some accidental bugs that we actually wanted to put back in! That was in itself a good learning exercise, which looked easier on paper.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In preparation for the bug hunt event in March, members of Scott Logic\u2019s growing test team have now trawled through the app; we\u2019ll be a bit embarrassed if the hunt throws up too many bugs we weren\u2019t expecting! Come to think of it, that may make a nice prize category on the day, the team that finds the most </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unexpected</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bugs.</span></p><p>The developed application will require testers to form teams and collaborate to effectively find bugs. This teamwork element is an important factor in making the event as fun as possible, bearing in mind the free beer and pizza won\u2019t arrive until after the awarding of prizes.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope attendees will leave the event and consider a career in software testing, or at the very least, appreciate the effort testers put in to help deliver high quality software, and the challenges of their role.</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">insider tips</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve identified a series of categories for which prizes will be awarded. Some are already defined and some will be awarded as spot prizes.</span></p><p>Teams will need to decide quickly what their test approach is going to be, how to prioritise and gain test coverage of the features, and whether to spend time looking for a few high impact, difficult to find bugs, or log more of the more straightforward ones. They\u2019ll need to think about how much time and effort to spend describing the bug in a report, bearing in mind that it needs to be easy for someone else to understand, recreate and resolve.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cynic in me expects the most popular approach will be to find the bugs that help win the prizes. Each team will be able to see how others are faring, which prizes have been won and which are still up for grabs; they may adapt their approach as everyone\u2019s bug logs are analysed over time. \u00a0</span></span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the main event</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned before we\u2019ll be hosting a bugathon alongside Newcastle University Computing &amp; Technology Society (NUCATS) on campus on March 18th.\u00a0</span></p><p>We\u2019ll be projecting a leaderboard for all to see; teams will be awarded points for finding bugs and the quality of their bug reports, while points will be deducted for logging duplicates! I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how different teams react to the changing state of the board.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m also eager to hear from each team about how they approached the task, what information or experiences informed this, and how they adapted their approach as they learned more about the application. Individual inventiveness should never be underestimated, so I\u2019m expecting to see each team come up with something quite different. </span></span></span></p><p>If you're interested in starting a career in testing why not take a look at our <span style=\"color: #c41565;\"><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/vacancies/graduate-software-tester/\" style=\"color: #c41565;\">Graduate Software Tester Programme</a>.</span></p>"},

The day had a number of lightning talks on subjects like: Git, HTML5, CSS and D3FC. They were then set to work on GradTrader - the app had a number of purposely placed holes in it, their task was to find and fix them.</p><p>The day was finished with the obligatory grad week go karting session. Unfortunately a huge rain cloud decided to pass through as they were on the track but \u00a0they didn\u2019t let their drenched clothes dampen their spirits.

In the morning they focused on manual testing: she got them to think outside the box when creating mind maps and to test ideas for GradTrader. They then went away and tested using the heuristics and test ideas they\u2019d produced. </span></p><p>In the afternoon they focused on integration and e2e testing and they wrote their own automated tests using what they had learnt in the morning. At the end of the day Hannah started them off on a \u201cbug hunt\u201d with prizes for the team that found the most interesting bug, and the team that found the most bugs. One team found 19 bugs in 20 minutes, and another team found that the graph in the application went back past the 1800\u2019s, when we are pretty sure one of the currencies in question didn\u2019t even exist\u2026</p><p>Finally, the week was finished off with a well deserved pint at the Town Wall in Newcastle.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of our Consultants Sam, who put together the graduate programme said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great week for the grads to get to know each other and the company.

Simply Googling isn\u2019t enough to get a really good impression of the number of options there can be. Most undergraduates I spoke with were at an early stage in their studies and career decision-making, so it was nice to feel we were being useful to them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I spoke about what I do in my day to day work as a </span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/our-people/hannah-newcastle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tester</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Scott Logic</span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com\"></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it was really nice to see people\u2019s interest in </span><a href=\"//smarter.scottlogic.com/careers/tacklingthemythsaroundasoftwaretestingcareer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as it\u2019s a career option a lot of people haven\u2019t really encountered before they enter the world of work. And people seemed generally interested in our </span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/graduateprogramme/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">graduate programme</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is great news.

There were a lot of very interesting ones, on topics ranging from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gender divide in technology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and whether </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video games are a sport,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">machine learning</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voice-controlled telepresence robots</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My personal favourite was on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">software testing - a myth or priority</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Talking to the student who wrote this, we discussed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some of the pitfalls testers encounter, how working as a team with developers can aid in testing, and a tester\u2019s role in getting a good quality final product out.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also managed to get to three of the presentations, one about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open source intelligence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technology for social good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and another about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the brain computer interface</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. All of these were dynamic and engaging presentations. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open source intelligence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> presentation was scary to say the least; the presenter showed us how within half an hour, she was able to collect great amounts of information on one individual person: where she worked, where she lived, where her family lived and where her boyfriend lived and worked. It showed that whatever we put on the internet is out there for whoever wants to see it, and that is quite unsettling if you think about that information getting into the wrong hands.</span></p><h2>Together we stand</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While my colleague John took questions as part of a panel at the end of the day, I reflected on what was all in all, a very good day. We\u2019re already signed up to sponsor next year\u2019s 10th annual colloquium and I\u2019m proud we remain committed to our involvement in the event. I hope that from a Scott Logic and a recruitment perspective we were both able to give assurance to the women in attendance that there is very much a career to be had for them in tech should they wish to pursue it, and meeting so many like-minded and enthusiastic women was fantastic.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as an industry moving forward, I feel events like this should include more men. After all, the issue these events try to address is the exclusion of, or unfair disadvantages for women when it comes to working in technology. There\u2019s a danger that by having women-only groups and events, we create a bigger divide rather than minimising it, and this can sour young impressionable people towards working in STEM. We must be careful or risk creating an impression for women and girls that there\u2019s an us and them culture in STEM, where females must stick together because they </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be discriminated against. This simply isn\u2019t the case, and the idea is enough to put anyone off a career path into STEM. All of us as women, alongside our male colleagues, need to collaborate to tackle this issue </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">together</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s an issue that in the end affects all of us, not just women. </span></p><strong><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applications for Scott Logic\u2019s 2016 graduate programme and </span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/internship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internships</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remain open, and from October this year, we\u2019ll also be taking applications for our 2017 opportunities.

It\u2019s the third annual competition held in the Newcastle office and as ever, it was full of surprises and enjoyment; 32 players battled it out to be crowned champion (and have bragging rights until the next noteworthy sporting event). Each player was randomly assigned a team from the real tournament, and matches were more or less synchronised with when your host nation played. The competition was so popular that we had to introduce eight additional teams in the form of micronations such as </span><a href=\"http://www.sealandgov.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Principality of Sealand</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.frestonia.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frestonia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><!--more-->One of the annoyances in the previous two years was organising matches, recording results and pestering people to get their matches played! These were all tasks that technology could easily solve for us, so this year we decided to use the competition to gain experience using new and exciting technologies. Slack is gaining widespread adoption globally and bots are becoming a big talking point in the tech world, so we decided to create a <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Slack table football-bot</span>, affectionately known around the office as MottyBot, after famed football commentator John Motson.</p><p><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg\" width=\"634\" title=\"Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"false\" style=\"width: 634px; height: 329px;\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=317&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 317w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 634w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=951&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 951w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1268&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 1268w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1585&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 1585w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1902&amp;name=Mottybot_capture_1-1.jpg 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\"></p><p><span>See MottyBot in action <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qUddq0nkQ2aFRrd3l1NVJEZXc/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BOTS it all about?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coupled with the rise of bots there has been a massive surge of interest in natural language text processors, or parsers, with Facebook\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://wit.ai/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Google\u2019s Parsey McParseface and many others still in development. We wanted our bot to be easy to talk to, so incorporating a natural language parser would allow us to gather information using specific commands. To make quick progress we used several packages to handle the core functionality: </span><a href=\"https://howdy.ai/botkit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botkit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provided easy integration with Slack, and Microsoft\u2019s recently released Botbuilder provided integrated access to its natural language parser </span><a href=\"https://www.luis.ai/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LUIS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these packages as a foundation, we quickly enabled the bot to record results, display upcoming matches and post new results to the main table football channel. Thanks to LUIS, people were able to interact with these core features in a natural way, talking to the bot rather than issuing instructions. There were plenty of features we still wanted to add, as well as challenges caused by working with emerging technologies. On several occasions LUIS, which was in beta, suffered outages and the bot failed as a result. Alongside that, the two bot kits were so new (Botbuilder was only three weeks old when we started), we had to inspect their code to understand or find functions and communicate directly with the developers to get help or report bugs. Working with such young technologies was certainly challenging, but it felt great to be part of such an early stage in its development.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bot\u2019s next?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of our main goals was to make the bot feel less bot-like. Having the bot understand natural language helped with this, but only with one direction of the conversation. We worked hard to train the parser to interpret incoming sentences, but if the bot always replied with the exact same messages and only spoke when spoken to, it would still appear robotic. We solved this by introducing a great deal of randomness to the bot\u2019s communication. This made it increasingly difficult to test. </span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For every possible function we provided a plethora of replies the bot could randomly pick from and personalise. We also added functionality to allow it to react to simple things such as \u201chello\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d. As well as randomising the responses, we gave the bot the capability to initiate posts, sending gifs, jokes and news stories randomly throughout working hours. This helped give the impression that it was active and not just waiting for people to talk to it. In the end you could have an interesting, albeit table football-based <span style=\"color: #c41565;\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qUddq0nkQ2eFdxbDlnUnpDMVE/view?usp=sharing\" style=\"color: #c41565;\">conversation</a>\u00a0</span>with the bot.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woops - botty mouth!</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it came to releasing the bot we quickly realised how differently everyone speaks. The bot had been trained to understand as many different ways to be asked and told things as we could imagine, and we were pretty confident in how it would perform. Within the first few hours we realised how wrong we\u2019d been. LUIS made it easy to examine incorrectly parsed sentences and correct them, so the more the bot was used the better it became. It wasn\u2019t long before MottyBot started to understand everything again, but this exposed him as a bot, and limited the user interactions we received.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One unintended effect of MottyBot\u2019s randomness was that he could be inappropriate. While his replies were specifically written by us, his joke and gif sources were </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scraped</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from rss feeds and websites. We checked these to ensure they were appropriate for the workplace, but one slipped past us. We quickly implemented a censorship feature that made the bot check with us whether a joke was ok to post. After Microsoft\u2019s bot which went a little </span><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/24/microsofts-teen-girl-ai-turns-into-a-hitler-loving-sex-robot-wit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too far</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re in good company, but it\u2019s a cautionary tale for those giving their bot too much freedom.</span></p><h2>bot's all folks</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bot was initially a two week exploratory project to see what could be accomplished, but as we made good progress we were given extra time to complete the bot and implement additional features people had requested. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the experimental and fast paced nature of the project, our choice of LUIS as a language parser was driven by its easy integration with the Botbuilder SDK. Given more time it would\u2019ve been interesting to look more closely at the other parsers available such as Wit or API.ai. If you\u2019re interested, our UX team has been looking at language parsers and </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/godds/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graham Odds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has written a couple of blog posts on their possible applications.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had a lot of fun developing our bot and, more importantly, we gained a great deal of knowledge about bot development and language parsing. We also experienced what it was like to work with constantly changing requirements to a tight deadline. The Scott Logic Euro 2016 table football final took place at our Friday Bar last week with an end result of 6-3 to England. Congratulations to Ali Sheehan-Dare who is now the official Scott Logic <span>Euro 2016 table football tournament</span> champion of 2016!</span></p>"},

Fast forward to now and what strikes me most is how much momentum has been gained for the cause in a relatively short space of time. This week, every news channel ran a feature or opinion piece focused on one or several inspirational women, or highlighting the huge discrepancies that exist in the rights women enjoy across the globe; even Facebook had an IWD banner I was encouraged to share to raise awareness.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inevitably, the day\u2019s increased profile has also given rise to growing debate as to its value, and concerns heralded by critics range from it being \u2018unnecessary\u2019 to the risk of encouraging positive discrimination and the potential damage that may cause. The same debate rages on in the world of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths), where women make up less than </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/jun/13/how-well-are-women-represented-in-uk-science\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 per cent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the workforce. And in software the statistics show the female workforce is only </span><a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/115998/survey-says-92-percent-of-software-developers-are-men/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight per cent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><h2>Don\u2019t play the blame game</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it\u2019s simply too easy to lay the blame at the door of the software industry, accusing it of discrimination, whether conscious or unconscious. It\u2019s also wrong to perpetuate the myth that women are generally less talented, capable or interested in the field, even if that\u2019s what they themselves believe. Worryingly, recent research revealed 60 per cent of girls are put off studying STEM subjects as they perceive them as </span><a href=\"http://www.recruitmentgrapevine.com/article/2016-03-03-empiric-wants-5000-women-to-be-interested-in-tech?utm_source=eshot&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=RG-03/03/16n\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too difficult</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But it was refreshing to see the tech sector being </span><a href=\"http://www.prweek.com/article/1386598/brands-gender-inequality-international-womens-day?bulletin=uk%2Fprweekdaily&amp;utm_medium=EMAIL&amp;utm_campaign=eNews%20Bulletin&amp;utm_source=20160309&amp;utm_content=www_prweek_com_article_1386598\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly active</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on social media this IWD.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's reassuring and perhaps a little perplexing that prejudice isn\u2019t what the growing number of women in our technical roles at Scott Logic tell us they\u2019ve experienced in their software careers so far. Rather, the lack of a gender balance exists due to the assumptions and cultural pigeon-holing that continue to take place in wider society.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sad truth is that we are all placed into our own identifying little boxes on the basis of crude categorisations including gender and sexuality, even in some cases before we\u2019re born. Think about whenever you have filled a form in. We are all easily shoehorned into these simple patterns of ticked or unticked boxes, and these permeate every aspect of our culture, from what we wear to the subjects we study and the jobs we do. Doors are closed for us before we\u2019re even aware of them. The sitcom The IT Crowd is testament to some of these stereotypes. Even the ads we see online are rigidly targeted according to age.</span></p><h2>We\u2019re all waking up</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s clear that there is still some way to go before society truly accepts and implements diversity, we are all becoming more conscious of bias. Slowly but surely, parents, schools and the media are waking up to the language they use, advice they give and opinions they have that can have such a huge influence on children, not least girls when choosing their future career path. Gradually, this will ensure the same opportunities to enter STEM fields are open to all, and that encouragement into those opportunities is equally shared regardless of gender.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses must also play their part to attract a broader range of people into considering one of the many varied roles software can offer. And this doesn\u2019t just mean at the point of sale. Employers must work with schools, colleges and other relevant bodies to ensure this \u2018attraction\u2019 work begins from an early age, and that the gender-based conditioning that has resulted in such a male dominated industry is confined to the history books.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Scott Logic, we are passionate about this, hence our ongoing involvement with the Lovelace Colloquium, a one-day conference for undergraduates organised by </span><a href=\"http://bcswomen.bcs.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCSWomen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a branch of the British Computer Society, the Chartered Institute for IT, which we\u2019ll be attending on </span><a href=\"http://bcswomen.bcs.org/?chronosly=bcswomen-lovelace-colloquium\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 31st</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The event honours Ada Lovelace, who is commonly regarded as the first computer programmer, and we\u2019ll be there in an effort to attract some talented engineers and doing our bit to #pushforparity. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope to see you there!</span></p>"},

The speakers clearly had something interesting and of value to other software practitioners as the monthly events slowly grew in attendance from perhaps 10 or 15 attendees, to past 30 and then 50, exceeding all expectations. Slowly but steadily the membership continued to build until it became clear that the existing venue in the old police station basement was no longer suitable (despite the novelty police cell toilets). A new venue was sought, options surveyed and the business incubator the EngineShed, settled upon.</span></p><p>The format remains unchanged since those early days; two speakers with 30-minute talks, followed by 15 minutes of questions from the floor. There\u2019s also always been beer on tap; with pizzas (and sometimes tacos) available after the talks. Nothing out of the ordinary for us, but hugely successful at eking out a meetup niche over time. The static speaker format is perhaps one of the reasons for its success, but the quality and diversity of speakers is likely a large factor. Local software developers have come to know that on the first Thursday of the month at the EngineShed, they will be informed and entertained by local (and passionate) practitioners on a wide variety of software-related topics. This is another key plank of the Bristech success; it is not just focused on software development per se, but encompasses a wider technical landscape, consisting of related topics such as UX, academic research and other local initiatives. This has led to a smorgasbord of topics over the past three years - from flying Nodecopters, Groucho Marx interventions on selfies(!) and swarm robotics, to functional reactive programming, big data analytics and a cyber-dojo.</p><h2>HITTING MILESTONES</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=320&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png\" alt=\"Bristech_Logo.png\" title=\"Bristech_Logo.png\" width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=160&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 160w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=320&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 320w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=480&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 480w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=640&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 640w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=800&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 800w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bristech_Logo.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=960&amp;name=Bristech_Logo.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\">In December 2015 membership of the group inched past 1,000, confirming it as the largest tech meetup in the South West.

Once this idea had taken hold, it became an all-consuming challenge that felt ambitious, but also like a natural brand extension. However, others privately advised that without a bona fide event organiser involved, things weren\u2019t likely to go smoothly. Running a conference is quite a step up from running a local meetup group. Luckily, I heeded this sage advice and engaged with a local event project manager who was to prove invaluable in running the event. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, on Thursday 15th October 2015, the doors opened @Bristol for the inaugural Bristech conference. This proved to be a sell out event consisting of 18 speakers across three different streams. With its focus on low cost tickets (early bird tickets went on sale at just \u00a330) and predominantly community-based (quality) speakers, the scene has been set for an annual event that complements the monthly rhythm of the meetups.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent Tech Nation report (2016</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), it notes that \u201cnetworks and face to face contact are essential to successful digital tech clusters\u2026almost 180,000 individuals across the country have been involved in digital tech meetups.\u201d In one sense, this rise charts the ongoing democratisation of knowledge; many meetups are used to share knowledge and ideas. However, it is also undeniable that events are inherently social. Just like other local tech meetups, Bristech is a good way for like-minded people to meet in relative informality.</span></p><h2>the benefits</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events are not only good for delegates; speakers benefit massively too. Local meetups provide an ideal opportunity for individuals to try out new ideas and further hone talks that may have only been aired within organisational walls. For example, employees at Scott Logic are actively encouraged to develop their ideas, firstly through blog posts, but subsequently through internal talks and presentations that translate well into public meetup sessions. Ambitions do not necessarily end there. Meetups can also lead to regional or national conference appearances. As such, they a great way to learn the craft of public speaking, in front of a friendly home crowd.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our monthly rhythm of events continues in 2016 with a full pipeline of speakers, and efforts are underway for the forthcoming October conference; a far cry from the damp days in the old police station.</span></p><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information on upcoming events, please follow </span></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bristechmeetup\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@bristechmeetup</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Twitter or visit the the meetup site at </span></i><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/bristech/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.meetup.com/bristech/</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All video content from previous talks are available on the </span></i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bristechmeetup\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

People have been testing for as long as software has existed. But many still don't see testing as a valuable career choice, or a career choice at all. This is partly due to a lack of education when it comes to testing, myths about the role of a tester and the way the software industry has approached testing in the past.</p><p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong>These have given rise to some common misconceptions:</p><h2>\u201cI'VE HEARD SOFTWARE TESTING IS BORING\u201d</h2><p>You heard wrong! Testing is misunderstood by many people and many organisations and neither test software in the right way. In software development, testing is quite honestly one of the most exciting and rewarding roles, providing you are in the right place; somewhere that will allow you to express yourself, be free to think creatively and utilise your testing superpowers.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing is varied. You can dig deep into different mindsets, use psychological techniques to </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/03/03/blink.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hunt bugs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, organise others to </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/10/20/Fun-effective-bug-hunts.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hunt bugs for you</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, get creative with both </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/10/19/automating-bacon.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technology and code</span> </a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/02/08/data-mocking.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solve difficult problems</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This idea of testing being boring may originate from testing practices such as laboriously creating test scripts, repetition in execution, testing for regression and high documentation environments. Much of the time, these tasks were really only checking (</span><a href=\"http://www.satisfice.com/articles/cdt-automation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">see checking vs testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and here\u2019s where we can use tools. We can use our development skills as testers to write creative code, utilise tools, develop testing software so that we don\u2019t have to do a lot of these \u2018boring\u2019 tasks manually.</span></p><h2>\u201cIT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO BE DEVELOPERS\u201d</h2><p>This certainly isn\u2019t the case. A lot of the time there may not be crossover between these two disciplines, and quite often, a different mindset separates great testers from great developers, but many developers started their careers as testers and many testers have been developers. This idea is apocryphal; it has perhaps come from places where testers and developers were adversarial, developers frustrated with low quality testing and testers frustrated with low quality code.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both roles are creative. Both can be technically challenging. Both aim to solve problems. An appreciation of one gives rise to a greater understanding of the other. At Scott Logic, respect goes in both directions. We aim to hire only the best.</span></p><h2>\u201cTESTERS AREN'T RESPECTED\u201d</h2><p>Any team or company that doesn't respect the role testers perform likely won't be producing software of the highest quality. Ask any of our developers and they will give an honest appraisal of respect for the role that testers perform. As much as any developer would like to think their code is perfect, it isn't and we make our developers look even better by finding where their code is broken so they can fix it before it\u2019s released.</p><h2>TESTER SKILLS</h2><p>A tester needs a rounded view of the world, a keen eye for detail and an investigative nature with some technical skills thrown in. You may have an artistic background but be great at maths or technical skills, or a scientific background with a methodical way of working, or a law degree with a passion for technology. There is no one mould that makes a good tester.</p><p>At Scott Logic, we look for passionate problem solvers with a keen interest in technology, that have a love of learning, sharing their knowledge and producing high quality work.</p><h2>CAREER PATH AT SCOTT LOGIC</h2><p>We have a clearly defined career path that aims to nurture, support and help your career grow in the way that you choose; from graduate to principal consultant we can provide you with the tools and knowledge to apply your skills, learn new ones and enjoy the freedom to continually think outside the box to solve problems.</p><p>In the next post in this series, we'll explore some of the types of project our testers get to work on and the kind of work you can expect to be doing as a tester at Scott Logic.

Here, I\u2019ll go into a bit more depth about current and past projects I've worked on, hopefully giving some insight into how testers work at Scott Logic.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since starting my current role in 2013, I\u2019ve been involved in a few projects. In the first, I joined mid way through the application's development, but even joining late, I was able to shape future ways of working and promote a better way of testing. I also learnt a lot, using technologies in depth that I had only briefly used before. I've been able to take that knowledge and experience to the project I'm currently working on, where I became involved much earlier.</span></p><h2>So what about some of those myths?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do testers do, if it's not writing and executing scripts?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Scott Logic, our testers are part of the development team and this is the case for my current project. I'm sat in the beating heart of the project team. We work with clients worldwide, although remotely from our UK-based offices. This makes communication a very important part of day to day work, from a morning scrum call, to conversing throughout the day with local or remote developers and business owners.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My current project works to a loose Scrum method with the aim of producing working software, rather than documentation, so I test within each sprint; as the development of features and fixes is finished, you are able to test them. By test, I mean \"...the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through exploration and experimentation, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each test informs me of the current state of the software being developed and I\u2019m able to use that information to generate new ideas and tests. I use various heuristics to uncover possible problems and I report on those problems either by creating bugs or talking to the right person, which goes to the heart of one of the values of the </span><a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agile manifesto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cindividuals and interactions over process and tools\u201d</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, we do use process and tools. It's not a chaotic jumble of random stuff. We have a flow of developed features and bugs tracked in a JIRA board. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1800&amp;name=jira-board.jpg\" alt=\"jira-board.jpg\" title=\"jira-board.jpg\" width=\"1800\" style=\"width: 1800px;\" data-constrained=\"true\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=900&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 900w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1800&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 1800w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=2700&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 2700w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=3600&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 3600w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=4500&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 4500w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jira-board.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=5400&amp;name=jira-board.jpg 5400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gives a view of the current sprint and this enables me, as a tester, to plan and move quickly. We use a branching strategy that enables me to test new features and fixes in isolation or altogether in a test branch. This test branch will contain all the changes that have been merged into development but is only built when I'm ready to continue testing. This way, I get a stable environment to test against, rather than developers pushing changes to the development branch and impacting the environment without my immediate knowledge.</span></p><h2>Where do I start?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, I'll look at bug fixes first. They can often be quicker to validate and in most cases, don't have as great an impact as new features, so less problems are likely to be found. Of course, that isn't always the case, particularly if a bug fix fundamentally changes the behaviour of some functionality, or the code change is complex and wide ranging. In this case, a quick chat with the developer may be needed. However, working within the sprint, sitting in the project team, I\u2019ve been able to get developers to note on the bug what impact this change is likely to have as a good approach for them to take, to make my, and their work easier. </span></p><h2>Delving a little deeper</h2><p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For new features, a more comprehensive look is needed. I often start with the acceptance criteria on the feature. Then, depending on what the new feature is, start exploring with some </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heuristics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><a href=\"http://www.satisfice.com/articles/sfdpo.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SFDPOT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/03/03/blink.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blink test</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/467\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">steeplechase, galumphing, creep and leap</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/04/of-testing-tours-and-dashboards/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tours</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/03/09/lonely-tester.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pair testing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I use my experience and knowledge of the application, and my lack of knowledge(!) in some cases, to spot patterns and check things I know have failed previously with similar features. For this, I keep a JIRA query of 'high risk failures'; bugs and features that I may want to keep re-checking regularly. I also use JIRA to mark features and bugs that I want to write automated checks for.</span></strong></p><p><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1800&amp;name=ticket.jpg\" alt=\"ticket.jpg\" title=\"ticket.jpg\" width=\"1800\" data-constrained=\"true\" style=\"width: 1800px;\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=900&amp;name=ticket.jpg 900w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1800&amp;name=ticket.jpg 1800w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=2700&amp;name=ticket.jpg 2700w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=3600&amp;name=ticket.jpg 3600w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=4500&amp;name=ticket.jpg 4500w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ticket.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=5400&amp;name=ticket.jpg 5400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we are using the Angular framework, this end-to-end automation is done using Protractor.

We\u2019ve found it\u2019s a real concern among non-computer science undergraduates who approach us at graduate careers fairs. The truth is, the name of your degree is secondary to skills such as logical thinking, coding or testing ability, and arguably most importantly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> passion. Here, two of our employees without computer science degrees explain more:</span></p><h2>I STUDIED ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING</h2><p><strong>Rob, who studied Electronic Engineering and joined us as a graduate developer in 2015, said: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen it boils down to it, all STEM degrees are based around different forms of problem solving; whether that\u2019s testing an electronic system for stability, or writing an application to track the transfer of bitcoins, everything can be broken down into small problems.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCoding was never something I thought I\u2019d be doing when I started my degree. However, it quickly became my favourite lecture every week, up to the point where I chose a C-based final year project and spent a placement year doing coding. \u00a0I also have some experience with C++ (purely as a procedural language) and assembly, but my primary language is C, and none of my experience comes in the form of object-oriented languages.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt uni, the assignments just clicked for me, and while a lot of others in my degree didn\u2019t particularly enjoy the coding lectures, it turned out to be exactly what I loved about engineering - being given a problem and using my knowledge to solve it. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter what degree you have behind you; if you enjoy coding and have a passion for solving puzzles, Scott Logic is the perfect place for you!\u201d</span></p><p>Rob has now been at Scott Logic for four months, and feels he has learnt a great deal in a short space of time. He added: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy first project revolved around Java and JavaScript, which I had very little knowledge or experience of so I was thrown in at the deep end a bit, but who doesn\u2019t love a challenge? While initially I felt a little out of my depth, I started to get my head around the project and by week two I was writing web applications without too much difficulty.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"By week four I was ready to work with two other graduates to make a browser-based game! It\u2019s a steep learning curve, but if you\u2019re willing to learn and like a challenge, it\u2019s more than possible, and really enjoyable too.\u201d</span></p><h2>WHAT ABOUT CIVIL ENGINEERING?</h2><p><strong>Luke recently joined us as a senior developer after a PhD in Civil Engineering, and said: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much programming involved in my undergraduate engineering degree at all, other than some number crunching with MATLAB, but my PhD was a different story.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI realised very early on in my project that flood simulation was going to be as much about how to leverage computing power as it was solving equations. Programming graphics cards and learning the nuts and bolts of processor architectures quickly became my favourite part of the PhD, so it seemed logical to pursue a software career afterwards.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMany other aspects of my degrees proved useful though, such as project management, communication skills, and designing algorithms. A PhD especially provides good training for taking a complicated problem and breaking it down into smaller tasks. Despite all this, it\u2019s not really the intricacies of how we work that excite me, it\u2019s the end result that I care most about; I think many engineers from all disciplines feel that way, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not essential to have a degree in computer science to be a good software engineer. And testament to that fact, I was surprised to find I wasn\u2019t the first civil engineer to find my way on to the Scott Logic team.\u201d</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re keen to see if a career in software might be for you, our paid summer </span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/internship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is currently open to applicants, and we also have a number of vacancies on our 2016 </span><a href=\"http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/graduateprogramme/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">graduate programme</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>"},

Sam, the experienced developer who put together the graduate programme said: </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\u201cWhilst relational database aren\u2019t the most modern of storage technologies, we still find most of our clients are using them and it\u2019s always a good place to start.

Once we\u2019d come down from our sugar high, we spent the evening toasting a great start to our grads\u2019 new careers at one of Newcastle\u2019s popular watering holes, where they got to know us and the city a little better.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Newcastle\u2019s Head of Development Rob said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen many of our graduates go on to achieve great things, often moving to senior positions within our project teams.

It\u2019s more about the technology.\u201d</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By the end of the afternoon, each team had something resembling a table football application, which would evolve throughout the week into a more sophisticated piece of software. Before hitting the pitch for an evening of full-size footie, the afternoon saw the grads briefed on software testing at Scott Logic, which for many was the first time working with those who specialise solely in this skill.</span></p><h1 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thursday</span></h1><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Anna, a member of our User Experience (UX) team, devised a practical session which let our grads\u2019 creativity loose. They experimented cutting bits of paper up and sticking them together in different ways as an introduction to the importance of design in the user interface. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Meeting our Technology Director Colin was a great opportunity to get a better understanding of the breadth of work our keen minds might get involved in throughout their Scott Logic careers. They learnt about CSS and Preprocessors. Less provided a focal point to the session as the grads are lucky enough to work with one of the technology\u2019s authors, Luke. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Lauren, a maths and computer science graduate from Bristol, said: \u201cI picked Scott Logic\u2019s graduate programme because I\u2019m really interested in applying the knowledge from my degree to a company where I can build great web applications. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\u201cThe week has been really good fun, not only because of the social side but, although intense, the work we\u2019ve been doing has been really interesting and enjoyable. Everyone\u2019s been really helpful. We\u2019ve been given the freedom to get to know the tools and techniques without being spoon-fed, but people are always close by if you need help or get stuck on something.\u201d</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By the end of the penultimate day of Grad Week, everyone had a table football ladder that was both visually pleasing and functioned around the needs of its user. They then headed to the local pool hall for a bit of good-natured competition and some refreshments to round off the day.</span></p><h1 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Friday</span></h1><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A look at some of the more modern features of HTML5 focused on WebSockets to implement a \u2018chat\u2019 feature in the culmination of the week\u2019s work - our table football applications. The systems raised a giggle or two as our graduates were surprised by a virtual Sam appearing on screen in real time </span><span>chat</span><span> to deliver feedback and ask questions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our grads were given the chance to individualise and embellish their table football applications before being grilled by our resident panel of technology experts</span><span>. </span><span>They were asked about the week\u2019s tasks and technologies, and explained why they\u2019d chosen their app\u2019s specific features.<br><br></span><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hubfs/scorelogic_resized.jpg?t=1511177678270\" alt=\"scorelogic_resized\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br>Judged on both the quality of their presentation and the appearance and functionality of the app, Jack and Lauren were crowned the best of the bunch and treated to a few pats on the back, as well as a customisable tiara each, at Friday bar - a monthly treat which is just one of the many perks of working at Scott Logic.</span></p><hr><p><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hubfs/Friday_bar_img.jpg?t=1511177678270\" alt=\"Friday_bar_img\"></p><p>It\u2019s great to have been able to welcome so many technically gifted people to the team.

Whilst this model does allow parallel work, its results pale compared to those of a team that constantly collaborates. Pair programming sessions, shared design and swarming on tasks allow much greater gains than a parallel working model, but these techniques also rely on communication skills for excellence to be achieved. \u00a0<br><br><strong>David, Senior Developer</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a UX Designer...</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rui, UX Designer</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a Tester...</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Daniel, Lead Tester</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a project manager...</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Communication skills are both written and verbal. With respect to project governance, written communication skills are paramount in effectively communicating progress and any risks identified, usually through a weekly status report. Verbal communication skills are essential in allowing the project manager to build effective relationships based on trust and respect, with both project stakeholders and development teams alike. Finally let\u2019s not forget the ability to listen and understand the meaning behind the words, from a project sponsor conveying the organisation\u2019s vision, to a developer explaining a technical task in detail to help inform a decision-maker.<br><br><strong>Paul, Project Manager<br><br><br></strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8ba36110-1bb1-1857-330d-463e8f30afec\">It can be easy to think of communication skills as more relevant to certain lines of work than others.

No doubt one significant reason for this is the impending, albeit amended, deadline for MiFID II in January 2018. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SHIFTING SANDS</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I attended <a href=\"/insights/etas-2016-an-experience-shared\" target=\"_blank\">ETAS</a> in November, startlingly few banks had even begun work on it, but judging by the number of requests we\u2018ve received for help so far this year, the Square Mile and Wharf have well and truly woken up to it now!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As new regulations continue to be handed down at pace from the FCA, the EU and other authorities, there are no shortage of companies designing solutions to address these requirements. Ever since the financial crisis, spending in IT for banks has changed dramatically, with most change budgets being assigned to compliance, or anti-fraud programmes, and very little else. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smart operators in town have responded to this in force, with a few FinTechs shifting focus to RegTech. This, in turn, has led to some significant mergers and acquisitions activity, with larger players acquiring niche product companies, such as NEX (formerly ICAP) buying out Abide Financial and integrating it to its suite of reporting products. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also note, from a summit I attended last month, that a lot of the larger banks are taking advantage of start up RegTech solutions, either investing in them significantly themselves, or using larger consultancies to ensure the solutions are \u2018enterprise ready\u2019 and credible.</span></p><h2>DATA'S ROLE IN REGTECH</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To use a familiar phrase, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data is king</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in RegTech. MiFID II has raised the stakes by requiring 65 reporting fields, with only 13 of the original 23 fields from MiFID I remaining unchanged. By anyone\u2019s standards, this is a huge increase, and stitching said data together is no mean feat, let alone putting it into a decent presentation layer! </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this in mind, new reporting products should be able to help, but getting the back end architecture in good enough shape to feed them is another challenge. At a recent <a href=\"/insights/fintech-code-themes-for-devops-and-agile-transformation-in-financial-services\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps conference I attended</a>, there were interesting discussions around how cloud technologies could be securely leveraged to address the increase in demand for infrastructure to serve these new requirements.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other end of the scale, a lot of larger institutions are still attempting to tackle the full MiFID II problem in-house, with disparate sources of legacy technology stacks being cited as the main reason. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2018ve heard tell of a few Big Data technologies being experimented with to overcome this, which would make a great use case, and help overhaul some creaking IT estates. Also, the far-reaching view of MiFID II across more asset classes means that approaches that were once siloed now need to be rethought to be more strategic and cross-functional across the enterprise. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the approach, be it adopting fresh new RegTech products, harnessing the expertise of third party consultancies, or using the wealth of knowledge retained in house, one thing\u2019s for sure - there\u2019s a lot to do and the window in which to do it is closing fast!</span></p>"},

Listening to the presentations, what stood out to me was that yes, there was luck involved, but the adage that you make your own luck - or perhaps the harder you work the luckier you get - has never been truer. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Whether it was a school careers adviser that sent a career down a certain path; a research contact that made a job available; or the flexibility afforded by academia to learn new skills, none of this would have been of any benefit without the foresight and ability each panelist had to take advantage of these lucky breaks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A second point of agreement was that the skills a PhD teaches go far beyond those directly linked to the research undertaken. There was no commonality on how directly applicable the panellists\u2019 PhD research had been to their subsequent careers. In some cases it was directly linked, while other contributors are now in a completely different industry, but the skills learnt in all cases had universal worth. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Perhaps the most obvious skill shared by the panel was problem-solving, the value of which cannot be underestimated, forming the basis of many PhDs. Perhaps less obvious are the communication skills that a PhD forces - often painfully - a student to learn. Whether it is the hours spent getting that paper under the word limit without removing any clarity or relevant information; the 15 minute presentation to give justice to a year\u2019s work; or the ability to argue a point while listening to an alternative viewpoint; all teach communication skills that are invaluable in the workplace.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It may not seem like it at the time, but even those many hours spent explaining programming fundamentals to first year students who are only taking computing as a timetable filler, teaches the invaluable skill of explaining complicated ideas in a way that even management can understand.<br><br> </span></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Audience Questions</span></h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A short Q&amp;A session was followed by an informal networking session over coffee. Again, while the backgrounds of the students was varied, a common concern seemed to be the perceived difficulty of making the switch to industry. Many students asked how they could \u2018catch up on lost time\u2019, or get to a level comparable to someone who has spent their time in industry while they have been earning a PhD. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It seemed there was an assumption that employers would view the time spent earning a PhD as wasted, and I am sure there are some employers who may view it this way. I would argue, however, that this time isn\u2019t wasted. It is merely spent differently. As previously mentioned, working on a PhD teaches a range of skills and provides opportunities that just aren\u2019t typically available in industry at graduate level; not least leading a three or four-year project and producing (hopefully!) a significant deliverable at the end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A second concern that was raised with me several times was more specifically related to PhD students interested in development roles. Many wondered how a PhD graduate with an undergraduate degree in Computing Science but limited development experience, would be viewed in comparison to a recent computing science graduate. The simple answer is that every case is different, but in my view a recent graduate and a PhD graduate are two very different individuals. The PhD has several more years of experience which, while not directly comparable to analogous experiences in industry, are valuable nonetheless. I certainly wouldn\u2019t view the time spent working towards a PhD as somehow devaluing the earlier computing science degree, and this was something some were worried about.<br><br> </span></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Scott Logic and PhD Graduates</span></h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Scott Logic has always looked for candidates with a strong academic background, and having a PhD very much fit this profile. That said, we are a technology company so we need our candidates to be able to demonstrate good technical knowledge as well as the smarts that come with completing a PhD. We take pride in staffing our offices with smart individuals who like solving difficult problems for our clients. This is true regardless of background, so it is crucial that you keep up to date with your preferred technologies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Keeping up with evolving trends is likely enough if you have worked on a PhD that required extensive coding - whether as the end product or a tool to support the research. If your PhD is less focused on development, you will need to maintain your skills in a different way. This could be by working on personal projects away from your research, or perhaps teaching software engineering courses. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>An interesting extension to the conversations that arose was around making the transition to industry after some years as a post-doc researcher. Again, there was a general concern that those years spent in academia would be viewed as worthless in industry and, conversely, that making this move would be throwing away all the time spent in academia. To the latter point I\u2019d say making any career change involves shelving some skills but I\u2019d suggest the alternative - remaining in the same silo for the rest of your career - is less appealing. How years spent in academia are viewed in industry very much depends on how those years were spent. From Scott Logic\u2019s perspective, working as a developer on a PhD research project raises the same questions as working as a developer in industry: </span></p><ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>how strong is your coding ability</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>how good are your communication skills; and</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>how would you fit into one of our teams? </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you can give suitable answers to these questions then we would absolutely want to hear from you. If you think there are gaps in your skill set then you should seek to fill these as much as possible; as you would if you were coming to us from an industrial role.<br><br> </span></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The PhD Horizons conference at Edinburgh University was a fantastic opportunity for me to engage with a wide range of PhD students and give an indication of some of the opportunities we can offer at Scott Logic. </span></p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7edbdceb-fce8-38ec-03fc-d53df04f4e99\"><span>Doing a PhD is a fantastic opportunity, not only to work on a piece of novel research, but also to learn new skills away from the research itself. When the opportunity arises - whether while completing the PhD or after some years in academic research - it should enable a relatively straightforward transition into industry; and Scott Logic would certainly be interested in hearing from you.<br><br></span></span>"},

And while cost reduction isn\u2019t front and centre in the digital service standards of the UK and Scotland, there remains an expectation to reduce costs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the standards do make clear is the need to identify performance indicators for any new service, of which four are pre-defined and mandatory. Unsurprisingly, the first of these focuses on cost:</span></p><ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-cost-per-transaction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost per transaction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - how much it costs the government each time someone completes the task your service provides</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User satisfaction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - the percentage of users satisfied with their service experience</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-completion-rate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Completion rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - the percentage of transactions users successfully complete</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-digital-take-up\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital take-up</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - the percentage of users choosing your digital service over non-digital channels.</span></li>\n</ol><h2>Getting from A to B: what does the roadmap look like?</h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To clarify </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital transformation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the UK\u2019s Government Digital Service (GDS) and the Scottish Government\u2019s Digital Transformation Service (DTS) have published the </span><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Service Standard</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://resources.mygov.scot/standards/digital-first/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital First Service Standard</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> respectively. These should be used as checklists for anyone carrying out digital transformation.</span><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Standards\u2019 criteria are sufficiently numerous that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. The DSS has 18 separate criteria, the first five of which are:</span></p><ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand user needs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put a plan in place for ongoing user research</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put in place a sustainable multi-disciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build the service using agile, iterative and user-centred methods</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build a service that can be iterated and improved upon on a frequent basis.</span></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are important considerations and encompass a huge wealth of knowledge that must lie behind successful digital transformation. For many this could seem overwhelming and all-encompassing. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good place to start is to ask two questions:</span></p><ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do we really understand how the current service works?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do we have a vision of what the future service should be like?</span></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The questions are simple but the answers more difficult.</span></p><h2>Embracing the impact of current performance</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may seem counter-intuitive to look at the existing service. But many public services have existed for a long time, their underlying processes and systems having been built up over time, without any formal central documentation. In some cases, a process description may be out of date, but only the people who carry out the existing process realise this. In other cases, computer systems may have been delivered that failed to meet requirements, with manual processes introduced to compensate, without any widespread recognition. To duplicate any of these formally defined systems would duplicate a system that doesn't work.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s far too easy to underestimate or misunderstand an existing service, or attempt to reproduce a system that doesn't work. Across pockets of the public sector, there are lots of good, tried and tested approaches to understanding existing services. Thought provoking starting points to this approach include:</span></p><ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.triarchypress.net/john-seddon.html\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freedom from Command &amp; Control</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systems Thinking in the Public Sector</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both by John Seddon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The underlying principles of systems thinking are not unique to this author, but he's provocative and the read is both interesting and applicable to the UK public sector </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/books/transform-rebels-guide-digital-transformation\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transform: A rebel's guide for digital transformation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Gerry McGovern</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Gerry is an endless source of the kind of common sense that isn't common in practice.</span></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, mapping services properly has become a specialised skill, part of the remit of User Experience (UX) designers. Sometimes mistaken for user interface designers who have a quite different skill base, UX designers are trained to map out and understand services from a user perspective, as well as find ways to redesign those services to make them more effective.</span></p><h2>A vision of the future</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the new world of Agile management and software design, it may seem that a clear picture of how a service works is all you need to get started on building something new. The Agile ideas of making small, incremental changes that always deliver a working system, and the repeatedly emphasised ability to adapt to rapid change seem both to remove the need and the value of creating long term plans. This is a common misunderstanding of Agile.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile management techniques haven\u2019t changed the long understood importance of having a clear vision of the future. While Agile </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enable work to start very quickly, without a long term vision this is a very bad way to start. It can lead to a false sense of productivity in an organisation that\u2019s pressured to deliver results but unclear about its strategy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile techniques focus on delivering quick results towards a long term goal. The agility enables the process to carry on effectively as the long term goals change; it does not provide a way of delivering effective results without a long term goal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital transformation is crucially hinged around leadership and a vision of the end goal. The innovative and technical skills needed to provide this may be quite different from those required in the day-to-day management of existing services. This may be relatively rare in organisations that have placed an emphasis on the maintenance and stability of existing services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many current initiatives in public sector organisations to hire and rapidly promote managers with these critical skills, but their value will not necessarily be realised immediately. In the meantime, the need to work with agencies to bootstrap transformation projects with the required Agile management and technical architecture skills will continue. Experienced skills in these areas are vital at the beginning of transformation projects to avoid common pitfalls, reduce risks and costs, and establish confidence in the vision.</span></p><h2>Navigating common pitfalls</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every digital transformation project is different, but there are many common issues and misconceptions.</span></p><p><strong>1. Combined customer services are not the same as combined computer systems</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The drive to reduce costs and deliver better and more customer focused services has led to a lot of discussion around delivering combined services. This may result in structural combining or collaboration between previously distinct service providers. Efficiencies of scale may be sought from structural integration or operational efficiencies may be anticipated from removing or simplifying duplicated processes and paperwork.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s often assumed that combining services will also mean combining the back end computer systems that support those services. The correct recognition that data duplication is usually a bad thing may lead to an expectation that a better system is one that brings all the data together in one place.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out that contrary to former practice, modern back end system designs no longer enforce or rely upon centralising data. Indeed there are often strong arguments for system architectures that split large systems into smaller, more manageable systems that are designed to talk to each other. These systems spread risk, and can be more resilient to service failure, easier to maintain, and more readily scaled to address some of the massive loads demanded of services that address large proportions of the UK population.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, large combined systems can become exceptionally expensive to develop and maintain. Rather than facilitating agile service change, they can become the greatest barrier to change. If existing systems are already difficult to manage, combining them will only multiply the difficulties.</span></p><p><strong>2. Well intended governance may increase risk</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good, Agile processes are designed to minimise risk by breaking work down into deliverables within short time frames. If anything goes wrong, the end result is very quickly visible and the consequences of scrapping or reworking are low. These practices work best when they are built on multi-disciplinary teams, empowered to make the decisions needed to progress the work.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well governed public services often introduce boards of advisors that meet infrequently to provide strategic oversight. These practices are intended to reduce the risk of bad decisions going unnoticed. If strategic governance is considered critical to the kinds of decisions being made by an Agile team, then situations can arise where Agile teams are not fully empowered to make critical decisions, or the work is only very infrequently assessed. Both of these circumstances remove the risk-avoiding benefits of Agile practice.</span></p><p><strong>3. Digital transformation is ongoing</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fifth criteria of both the GDS and DTS states:</span></p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Build a service that can be iterated and improved upon on a frequent basis, and make sure that you have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to do so.\"</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this clear message, it\u2019s still commonplace to look upon digital transformation as a project that can be outsourced to a large IT consultancy. Indeed there are still situations where aspects of these 'projects' are considered sufficiently large and complex that they can\u2019t be carried out in any other way. But no public sector IT system should be so large and complex that only a handful of the world's largest consultancies are capable of delivering the product and handling the risk.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing and Big Data technologies have transformed the nature of large IT systems. In the past, there were only a few companies that understood and could manage the computing elements required to run large IT systems. But it\u2019s now possible to design and develop systems that can manage the high frequency demands of the entire UK population on a laptop computer, and then deploy that software, at scale, to meet any level of fluctuating demand.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern digital systems need to be manageable and flexible enough to be able to change rapidly to social and political changes. Digital transformation is about re-equipping the public sector with the skills and technologies that enable it to provide secure and reliable services, despite those changes.

They are beginning to explore where they fit within the Big Data cycle, and how to leverage data to turn it into actionable information. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post I examine a typical Big Data cycle, highlighting examples of how businesses are investing in Big Data and the direction this is taking.</span></p><h2>THE TYPICAL BIG DATA CYCLE</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data means different things to different people. It's basically defined as, data that's too complex to be processed on one machine. This can be due to various factors like the volume of it, the speed at which it\u2019s generated and processed, inconsistency, and the variety of its formats and sources. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data isn\u2019t new, but traditional processing applications weren\u2019t adequate to process these large and complex data sets. Newer technologies allow us to handle large scale data well, and carry out more detailed analysis to reveal patterns and trends. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To produce something meaningful from data, businesses need to manipulate it. This may involve having to parse and validate it, sorting it, or combining multiple sets of data before interpreting and visualising it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=500&amp;name=Big-data-components.png\" alt=\"Big-data-components.png\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Big-data-components.png\" caption=\"false\" data-constrained=\"true\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=250&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 250w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=500&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 500w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=750&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 750w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1000&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 1000w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1250&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 1250w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Big-data-components.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1500&amp;name=Big-data-components.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above diagram is a simplified view of a typical Big Data cycle. It shows each stage in the cycle and the leading technologies that could be used.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this cycle to work, the culture of Big Data needs to be embedded in the organisation\u2019s business strategy.</span></p><h2>BIG DATA AT THE CORE OF THE BUSINESS</h2><h3>Enhancing customer experience and informing business decisions</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data analytics can be used to enhance the customer\u2019s experience. Within retail, businesses can collect data about consumer behaviour in store and feed it back to the retailers and manufacturers. Knowing who users are allows businesses to better cater for them. They can use Big Data analytics to optimise promotions, implement targeted marketing, enhance the use of shelf space in the store, or improve demand forecasting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, insurance firm\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.admiral.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Admiral</a>\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced that it wanted to analyse the Facebook accounts of first time car owners to price their insurance. The project was prevented by Facebook, who wished to protect the privacy of its users. This controversy aside, we can look at this as an example of the type of insight businesses are trying to gain. Admiral\u2019s </span><em><a href=\"https://www.firstcarquote.com/#/desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">firstcarquote</a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was to be optional and would have offered discounts to users deemed safe drivers, based on its analysis of the potential clients\u2019 Facebook posts. It analysed linguistic characteristics such as excessive use of exclamation marks. It looked for personality traits that it thought were linked to safe driving and used that information to inform its pricing strategy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data analytics can help inform business decisions. For example, when merchant bank </span><a href=\"http://www.closebrothers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Close Brothers</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wanted to find optimal locations for expansion, it used statistical and geospatial modules to gain insight into where its customers live in relation to its branches. This allowed the firm to identify target locations for potential expansion. </span></p><h3>Sustaining competitive advantage</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data can give a business an edge over its competitors. </span><a href=\"http://www.gracenote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gracenote</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has the largest database of all music collections, with more than 28 million songs. Its online services handle a trillion queries a month. Leveraging its database, it built music recognition software </span><em><a href=\"http://musicid2.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MusicID</a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which it uses to identify files and deliver track metadata, and relevant content. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MusicID</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> retains audio fingerprints - unique digital identifiers for audio files that can then be used in queries. It identifies files by combining the audio fingerprint with its matching text. Users can view information like the artist\u2019s page, biography, older releases and most popular songs. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gracenote</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s database gives it an advantage over competitors like </span><a href=\"https://www.shazam.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Shazam</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><h3>Enhancing security</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advances in data science and real time analytics can drive major improvements in fraud detection and enhance security. This type of problem is time sensitive and requires immediate action, and while it used to take days to detect problems, Big Data analytics can detect anomalies in real time, so they can be addressed straight away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, banks can monitor and track the digital behaviour of users to prevent fraud. They can monitor how fast users generally type in their username and password, the geographic location from which they log in to their accounts, or frequent commands they use. A change in their behaviour can be quickly flagged. Cognitive systems can be used to prevent security threats at an unprecedented speed. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transport network </span><a href=\"https://www.uber.com/en-GB/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently partnered with </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using its cognitive service</span> <em><a href=\"https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-cognitive-services-at-the-heart-of-ubers-real-time-id-check\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Real-Time ID</a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to verify the identity of the driver. The driver takes a selfie that should match the picture associated with his or her account, to prevent fraudulent use. It instantly compares the photo sent by the driver to the one in the database and blocks the account if there\u2019s no match. </span></p><h3>Predictive analytics and enhanced performance</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data can be used to improve the efficiency of an application and report issues in real time.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While reporting on the data is important, it\u2019s only the first step. One of the greatest benefits to organisations of investing in Big Data is the ability to accurately predict what\u2019s likely to happen. This is only possible with a large volume of data. This is how </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shazam</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, is able to predict the next number one song. Users have uploaded 15 million songs to be identified. This makes it possible to know what users are listening to at any given time, and to identify the tracks with the biggest spikes in the number of listeners. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Big Data analytics to anticipate results is particularly useful for predictive maintenance. Data is used to learn about the current condition of a product, and predict when maintenance is needed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/cloud-platform/internet-of-things-azure-iot-suite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft's Azure IoT suite</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">propulsion solutions provider, </span><a href=\"http://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rolls-Royce</a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is collecting and analysing airline operations data to ensure reliable operation, improve performance, reduce maintenance costs, reduce fuel consumption and detect technical issues before they even happen. Previously the company only analysed engine data. The engine monitoring system uses sensors to gather real time information about the health and performance of the engines. For instance, it collected data about the amount of fuel needed to make a set amount of power. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, because it has the technology to process and analyse bigger sets of data, it receives data streams from both the engines and aircraft, and the aircraft monitoring system enables more information to be captured. For example, it can detect unusual aircraft speed and collect technical logs and black box data. This analysis then feeds into the product design, manufacturing and support.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly,</span> <a href=\"http://www.geaviation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GE Aviation</a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integrates flight data and analytics to optimise fuel consumption. By measuring how something currently functions, analysing inefficiencies, optimising performance and predicting failures, it turns the engine from a product into a service, allows repairs to be planned for scheduled downtimes. </span></p><h2>THE FUTURE OF BIG DATA</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Data is useful for understanding how users interact with a product and detecting anomalies in real time, but its true potential is in its ability to predict what\u2019s going to happen, rather than reacting to an event. It\u2019s gradually moving from simple data reporting to more advanced analytics, with predictive modeling and machine learning. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there\u2019s a lot of value in Big Data projects, one of the main challenges that businesses will need to resolve is privacy protection for their users. We\u2019ve already seen an example of that issue with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admiral</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">firstcarquote</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> project, and some insurers even charge higher premiums for customers thought to be less likely to switch providers based on data analysis. There has always been a struggle to balance the use of data to drive business value, and respecting user privacy. This is set to become even more prominent now that data is constantly generated by everything around us and we\u2019re better able to process it. </span></span></p>"},

In accepting, the Minister said: \u201cWe are committed to the\u00a0UK\u2019s Open Government National Action Plan, which sets out our commitments to greater openness, transparency and civic participation.\u201d\u00a0The Government has tried to harness the potential benefits of involving SMEs in the public sector marketplace for many years. The departments the National Audit Office spoke to, agreed that SMEs can offer a number of benefits to the public sector, compared with other providers, including more flexibility and innovative approaches (NAO March 2016).</p><p>However, that demand for speed and success is set against a backdrop of legacy technology, processes, suppliers and procurement methods. And that demands a massive culture shift, to the extent that Digital Transformation may be about change management as much as it is about technology.</p><h2>Change means culture means team</h2><p>Culture is intrinsic to effective change management. According to <a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Cultures-Critical-Role-in-Change-Management?gko=a3f98\" target=\"_blank\"><u>DeAnne Aguirre and Rutger von Post</u></a> of PwC, \u201cCulture can be a great enabler of organisational change \u2013 whether the change involves digitisation, faster product development, or a systematic lowering of costs.\u201d</p><p>Of course, being able to create the right culture depends significantly on the team you have, and that, in turn, depends on the team\u2019s ability to agree a shared goal and to move, as one, towards that goal. Getting the right team in place is no small challenge. At the most fundamental level, Digital Transformation demands <em>more</em> people, <em>new</em> skills and <em>different</em> ways of working before the transformation work can even begin. So how do you put your team together?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=500&amp;height=242&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg\" alt=\"Public sector blog fig 1-2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"242\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=250&amp;height=121&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 250w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=500&amp;height=242&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 500w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=750&amp;height=363&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 750w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1000&amp;height=484&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 1000w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1250&amp;height=605&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 1250w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1500&amp;height=726&amp;name=Public%20sector%20blog%20fig%201-2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"><em>People, process and procurement are at the heart of Digital Transformation</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0</p><h2>Assembling your team: 5 key options</h2><h3>1) Employing more staff</h3><p>It may seem tempting to take on additional staff with the required skillset \u2013 after all, employment gives you greater control. But the acute shortage of those skills makes good people very hard to find \u2013 and correspondingly expensive. While they may be more cost effective than an outsourcing firm or a big consultancy, their \u2018digital bonus\u2019 could well unsettle and demoralise your existing staff.</p><p>Fast-rising, highly skilled specialists may not find the public sector sufficiently attractive, especially given the arduous job-application process. There\u2019s no guarantee that they won\u2019t leave prematurely (perhaps affected by a lack of morale in the existing team, or demotivated by legacy approaches), leaving you facing the same recruitment challenge all over again. Nor is there any guarantee that, should they stay, they won\u2019t absorb the pre-existing culture or fall behind with their skills.</p><p>Furthermore, a room full of disparate people doesn\u2019t instantly become a cohesive, high-performing team, no matter how skilled or enthusiastic. There\u2019s a steep learning curve when it comes to your domain expertise and you need to create a project culture, all while designing your roadmap. And that\u2019s without having to get <em>today\u2019s</em>\u00a0work done, too. And what do you do with all of these people once the project is up and running?</p><h3>2) Contracting staff in</h3><p>Contracting has its appeal: you get fast, flexible access to skilled people without affecting your own staff budget or pay scales. Contractors just want to get the job done, and then move on somewhere else \u2013 and you can tell them what to do. On the downside, they just want to get the job done (perhaps not fully participating in the team culture or the wider project); they may move on <em>too soon</em>; and you have to tell them what to do!</p><p>Contractors may have the technical know-how, but they\u2019re unlikely to know your domain. And because they\u2019re effectively self-employed individuals, they may not work well as part of a team and need a lot more oversight and management. While some will show initiative or take responsibility, most will have limited commitment to the organisation or the project. Plus, with their skills in such demand, they could be lured away at any moment. It may also be painful for existing staff to discover the pay rates of contracted staff. \u00a0</p><h3>3) Outsourcing</h3><p>Historically, outsourcing all or part of a project or service has been a commonplace model in the public sector. After all, you benefit from pre-determined costs and timescales. You devolve a large piece of work, along with the risk, to another organisation in exchange for a set fee, leaving you free to get on with something else.</p><p>But outsourcing is inherently problematic, which is why the Government has stated it wants to move away from it. For example, there\u2019s the long and costly process of negotiating and specifying the project to begin with \u2013 and once the deliverables have been carved in stone, there\u2019s little scope for flexibility or change. You are locked-in and it is costly to change. Outsourcing firms often have their own ways of working, so you\u2019re more likely to have to adapt to <em>them</em>\u00a0than they to you, all of which makes outsourcing a poor match for the flexible, modular approach demanded by Digital Transformation.</p><h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">4) Consultancy\u00a0</span></h3><p>Consultancy offers the appeal of a well-respected firm of specialists, but it also shares many of the disadvantages of outsourcing. Traditionally, the big consultancies have tended to deliver discrete projects to a defined specification, and at a relatively high cost, under the terms of a detailed contract. As with outsourcing, this is at odds with the vision of Digital Transformation, which doesn\u2019t seek to have all the answers before a project begins \u2013 or to have a single organisation deliver the lion\u2019s share of a project.</p><p>Since consultancies, unlike outsourcing companies, tend to work alongside you, you might expect to participate in two-way knowledge transfer: you hope to add to their <em>domain</em> knowledge while they add to your <em>technical</em>\u00a0knowledge. However, it doesn\u2019t always work out that way; some consultancies are less generous when it comes to sharing expertise, and you may be left with no one in-house who can solve similar challenges in future.\u00a0</p><p>However, a tendency towards using their familiar technologies may lead to 'lock-in' and difficulties in the transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Plus, your snagging phase may last long after the consultancy\u2019s departure (\u2018parachute in, catapult out\u2019).</p><h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">5) partner with an sme\u00a0</span></h3><p>The Government\u2019s stated intention is to pull back from large, unwieldy contracts with large, unwieldy suppliers. As a result, SMEs now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/performance/g-cloud\" target=\"_blank\"><u>supply more</u></a> to the G-Cloud than big businesses do; in June 2016, for example, 63.5 per cent of G-Cloud sales were by SMEs. And this will only increase, since SMEs can represent a very good fit with the Technology Code of Practice.</p><p>But according to the National Audit Office (March 2016), the Government reported that more than\u00a025 per cent of its spending reached SMEs in 2014/15. It now aims to increase this to 33 per cent by 2020. However, the NAO can't be certain the amount the Government spends with SMEs has increased since it set its original target in 2010. The NAO recommends that if the Government is serious about increasing its use of SMEs, it will need to focus on those areas where SMEs can deliver real benefits.</p><p>Scottish finance secretary Derek Mackay\u00a0has <a href=\"http://futurescot.com/co-design-will-heart-scottish-government-digital-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>argued for</u></a> \u201cmore \u2018co-design\u2019 of digital government, insisting collaboration with micro businesses and even individuals could revolutionise the way public-sector services are delivered\u201d.</p><p>SMEs are typically nimble, adapting readily to changing requirements. And because they operate in a very competitive band of the market, they tend to be highly responsive, willingly accountable and, of course, cost-effective. They also sit in that sweet spot of size, scope and approach; they don\u2019t need every last detail ironed out before they\u2019ll get started, like an outsourcing company; nor do they take the \u2018land and expand\u2019 approach of the large consultancies. On the other hand, neither are they a small team of 10 independent contractors waiting to be told what to do.</p><p>SMEs often bring with them invaluable thought leadership, plus the latest technologies and best practices from across the commercial sector, which may not yet be commonplace in public services. You have a good chance of finding a business which is already up to speed with the criteria required by the Digital Service Standard; for example, many will be familiar with Agile methodologies, and will favour pragmatism over substantial pieces of bespoke development.</p><p>One approach increasingly offered by SMEs, and of major appeal to Digital Transformation projects, is to place a team of experts in-house with you or a hybrid flexi-working, thereby augmenting your own staff. This team is scalable at short notice; you might begin with one or two technical architects to help you define your roadmap before ramping up the team with service designers and user experience designers, adding developers as and when required. Potentially, you might culminate with a team of trainers and support staff for the early stages of delivery.</p><p><span>The team imported from a reasonable sized SME always has access to additional expertise back at base. Significantly, SMEs are far more likely to be concerned about building trust and developing a long term relationship, ensuring that they have carried out the knowledge transfer work so that your team is comfortable self-managing the outcomes.\u00a0</span>Overall, this enables you to build an agile, highly skilled team in less time, with a shorter learning curve for both the implanted team, in terms of your domain, and for your own staff in terms of methodologies and technologies.</p><h4><strong>Summary of options</strong></h4><table style=\"height: 774px;

Allow us to shed some light.", "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2008, when the mysterious </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satoshi Nakamoto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> registered the domain name </span><a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bitcoin.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, awareness of the peer-to-peer currency has steadily grown, and it has been joined by other second generation cryptocurrencies hailing themselves to be the future of money. But are we really close to that being the case when the average Joe is still unclear on what Bitcoin is? Allow us to shed some light.</span></p><h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is the biggest and arguably the </span><a href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most well known</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> digital currency in the market. It\u2019s a cryptocurrency; a currency where ownership of money or 'coins' is proven mathematically, and last year, the number of global merchants accepting payment in Bitcoin </span><a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-now-accepted-by-100000-merchants-worldwide-1486613\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surpassed 100,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two methods of acquiring Bitcoin, firstly by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mining</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it, or secondly, by purchasing it at an exchange. A miner is a single member of the network, whether an individual trader or a large corporation, as in most cases. Miners spend their time on the network validating transactions to create the next chapter (or block) of the currencies ledger. The network is a huge group of miners, all racing to check transactions and create the next block.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A block is currently around 1Mb of data, or around 1,000 to 2,000 transactions, and there\u2019s one block created approximately\u00a0every 10 minutes. Each time a block is created, other miners will verify that the submitted block is valid, and all the transactions it contains are also valid. A huge publicly accessible ledger called the Blockchain exists, in which everyone submits transactions ie when Bitcoin changes hands, for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">miners</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to read and either accept or reject, depending on whether they can be proven mathematically valid.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to see the public ledger for Bitcoin, it can be viewed at \"</span><a href=\"https://blockchain.info/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://blockchain.info/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\". On this website you can see every transaction occurring around the world, as well as new blocks as they are created. Mining is a very difficult process as the number of miners you are competing against is huge. It\u2019s very unlikely that over a year an individual miner will successfully mine a single block for Bitcoin, but if they do, the reward for that block is 12.5 bitcoins ($7113.25 USD - 16/08/2016).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing from an exchange is the easiest method of acquiring bitcoin. Several major exchanges such as Poloniex, BTC-E, Bitfinex and Kraken allow users to associate bank accounts to purchase cryptocurrencies. One off payments can be made to smaller holding companies such as coinbase. And like any other currency, you are able to use an exchange to cash Bitcoin into a more convenient currency, like USD, EUR or GBP. With all exchanges, there will be a small fee associated with transferring the money, but this can be offset, given you\u2019ve made enough profit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To spend any money in a cryptocurrency network, you need to be able to prove you own the coins you want to spend. In the case of transactions involving very large amounts, the miner will receive a minimum fee, which is a condition built into the underlying algorithm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To spend Bitcoin, you first need an address to pay money into. Whoever is involved in the transaction will provide </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addresses</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to which Bitcoin can be paid. The term </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this context refers to very large numbers calculated using things only the owner of that </span><a href=\"https://blockchain.info/address/152f1muMCNa7goXYhYAQC61hxEgGacmncB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knows, and written in a form convenient and secure for users. Running some maths as an owner spending money from an address is how you prove ownership of the address, and therefore the Bitcoin in the transaction. An example of a Bitcoin address is </span><a href=\"https://blockchain.info/address/152f1muMCNa7goXYhYAQC61hxEgGacmncB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">152f1muMCNa7goXYhYAQC61hxEgGacmncB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given to the Bitcoin handler of your choice, in the same way you interact with your high street bank for example, a transaction will be created using money located at addresses you currently own. The transaction will pay the recipient and also pay out to an address you own (for your change). Once money at an address has been spent, it cannot be returned. Instead, money in Bitcoin moves from address to address, and when using the network as it should be used, this recipient shouldn\u2019t be at the same address more than once. This is to protect against potential hackers, as the more you re-use an address, the more information you give to them, in the same way as you shouldn\u2019t use the same password for multiple online accounts.</span></p><h2>So should I be trading in Bitcoin?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin, while still a small community relative to the countries behind foreign exchange currencies, currently has a $9 billion market cap (correct at the time of writing). It can be volatile to the point where it changes +/- five per cent over the course of a day, with other cryptocurrencies seeing shifts of +/- 30 per cent. Investment in cryptocurrencies can be extremely profitable, albeit very risky. There is a fairly low risk of hackers or any other online threats accessing your money. The danger of losing money to hackers or other threats is greater if you are handling your own private keys and addresses. Giving an exchange the task of calculating and arranging payments reduces the chance of you losing money.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is primarily bought by people who are looking to invest. The highly volatile nature of the currency makes it very profitable for short term investments, albeit very risky, and several high profile names are being heralded as </span><a href=\"http://www.altcointoday.com/top-5-bitcoin-millionaires/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin millionaires</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There are several websites which currently allow you to pay in Bitcoin and it has become a more popular payment method in recent years.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent security breaches in cryptocurrency markets are in no way related to the underlying core blockchain algorithm that forms the basis of all cryptocurrencies. The two largest breaches in recent times are the DAO (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized Autonomous Organisation)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hack ($132.7m at the time) and the Bitfinex ($72m at the time). The DAO is a cryptocurrency which runs atop another cryptocurrency network (ethereum). The breach involved exploiting smart contracts which are used to compromise the DAO. These smart contracts are not part of the blockchain algorithm. The breach at Bitfinex did not involve attacking the blockchain, but rather the exchange itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both cases, the underlying blockchain algorithms were not compromised and so remain safe. The basis of blockchain security is a cryptographic function, which to date has not been broken. This makes the currency itself secure; the danger in cryptocurrencies comes from losing your keys which prove you own coins. Most exchanges will handle keys for you, and in the event of hacks, the exchanges have refunded customers who have been victims in the past.</span></p><h2>What could the future look like?</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Bitcoin is currently a hugely volatile market, over the coming years we expect its growth will also provide stability. Right now, it\u2019s a brilliant place to go for a quick return on investments, but its influence is ever expanding, and outside trading there are already potentially huge implications for how the underlying algorithm could be used by different industries, such as </span><a href=\"http://bravenewcoin.com/news/contest-launched-to-find-blockchain-solutions-to-us-healthcare-problems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example. And high street bank Santander has reportedly identified up to 25 potential </span><a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/santander-has-20-25-use-cases-for-bitcoins-blockchain-technology-everyday-banking-2015-6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the currency.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, because the ledger is inherently so secure, very public and so widely distributed, it could inspire businesses to implement their own blockchain to prove purchases and log transactions, minimising the likelihood of human error.

Although not a games company, Scott Logic welcomes the transferable skills and experience built up from this kind of project such as JavaScript and Scrum. </span></i></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><!--more-->After six weeks\u2019 induction and intense HTML5 training, which exposed us to a plethora of new technologies and libraries, we finished our first project project building a simplified trading platform. We were ready to move onto something new, and this something new was a game which was one of the worst kept secrets ever!</span></p><h2>the idea</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After an initial brainstorming session we narrowed our choice of game down to a \u2018Metal Slug\u2019 style platformer with cooperative play, or a player vs player top down shooter, which was described as \u2018Pacman where you can also play as the ghosts\u2019. Whilst a cooperative game would have been fun to produce, the lure of player vs player was too strong. Choosing a theme was harder and deciding zombies is an overused genre, we decided on human vs demon.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;height=528&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png\" alt=\"Hell_escape_image.png\" width=\"634\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=317&amp;height=264&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 317w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;height=528&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 634w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=951&amp;height=792&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 951w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1268&amp;height=1056&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 1268w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1585&amp;height=1320&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 1585w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Hell_escape_image.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1902&amp;height=1584&amp;name=Hell_escape_image.png 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\"></span></p><h2>the tech</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were provided with a list of recommended technologies to use and guidance on how to get everything set up and then we were, to an extent, let loose. Node.js was highly recommended for the server and, as JavaScript was the the main language where our experience overlapped, it was the obvious choice. For any online multi-player game, the communication channel needs to be low latency, with a two-way connection between the client and server. With this in mind we used Socket.IO for the vast majority of the app. We also used Fetch (the next iteration of XMLHttpRequest) when sockets were unnecessary.</span></p><p>The client side of the game was implemented using the JavaScript game engine Phaser, with the rest of the app utilising Knockout.js. Both of these are lightweight packages with Phaser chosen for two reasons: it uses WebGL to help keep the frame rate up, and it had previously been used by others in the office, giving us an easily accessible advice channel should we need it.</p><p>Knockout was chosen ahead of other libraries such as Angular and React due to its simplicity and ability to display constantly up to date information through the websocket. We also made use of the Webpack module builder to manage and bundle our Single Page Application (SPA)\u00a0assets.</p><h2>running the project</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Scrum implementation of Agile development, our weeks were organised into sprints with a main goal achieved by completing stories, tasks and fixing bugs. Although we had doubts this would be useful to a team of just two, it quickly became evident that we were better organised and tasks were being correctly prioritised and estimated, thanks to our daily and weekly meetings. It helped give the project a professional feel and the approach meant we continuously saw tasks we had wanted to tackle, but weren\u2019t essential, fail to make it into the game. Had we been given free reign to do as we pleased with the app, the final product may have been poorer for it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we undertook all production ourselves, we weren\u2019t alone. We were supported by other experienced employees acting as our scrum master, technical advisor and product owner. We\u2019d also be regularly stunned by complicated questions, which more often than not, would lead us to re-evaluate and change how we were implementing some functionality.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;height=592&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png\" alt=\"Project_DefeatScreen-1.png\" width=\"634\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=317&amp;height=296&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 317w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=634&amp;height=592&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 634w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=951&amp;height=888&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 951w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1268&amp;height=1184&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 1268w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1585&amp;height=1480&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 1585w, https://smarter.scottlogic.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Project_DefeatScreen-1.png?t=1511177678270&amp;width=1902&amp;height=1776&amp;name=Project_DefeatScreen-1.png 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\"></span></p><h2>lessons learned</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two of us on this project had a very different background which meant we brought distinct knowledge and skills to this project. However, the gap between a university project and a professional project is big and we\u2019ve been amazed by the amount of knowledge we\u2019ve gained through creating this game.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building the whole app from scratch gave us invaluable experience working with the full technology stack. We found certain areas more challenging, or more enjoyable than others, but it was both necessary and useful not to over specialise or actively avoid working on any particular part of the app. As a two person team, we took part in collective code ownership, we reviewed each other\u2019s code and therefore needed to fully understand and interpret decisions to ensure this wasn\u2019t a perfunctory task. Learning to regularly commit and share our code via Git, as well as effectively review each other's work was key to the game\u2019s development. \u00a0</span></p><h2>mocking is great</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of our development process we created unit tests for our code, but found we were unable to test functions that used websocket communication. We then decided to use mocking. By separating the socket communications into a separate layer, we were able to use a mock library to fake the socket and test what was previously untestable. Learning how to mock (and stub and spy) was a headache, but it significantly helped and looking back, was worth it.</span></p><h2>conclusions and improvements</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we are satisfied with the final game, it was nerve wracking to release it to the rest of the company to be played. But the feedback has been really encouraging and everyone seems to be enjoying it. \u00a0</span></p><p>There are several features we were unable to prioritise but given time we\u2019d like to implement. \u00a0For example, collectible items (or pick-ups) was trimmed. This would have introduced limited ammunition and health regeneration, adding a tactical element to the game. Making the health pick-ups appear as bacon sandwiches, cake and coffee would also resonate with many in the office.</p><p>Similarly, it seems five or six-player games were a lot of fun but games limited to two or three players could be less interesting. This could\u2019ve been improved with the addition of computer controlled opponents, but implementing artificial intelligence would be a complicated task. The demons \u00a0also had a slightly slower movement speed than humans which, in a two-player game ended up causing a \u2018Benny Hill\u2019 like situation. This was quickly and easily remedied by fine tuning the game\u2019s config file, allowing a single demon to catch and kill a human.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, it\u2019s been fun, interesting and challenging making our game. We\u2019re very pleased with the results and the amount of knowledge we\u2019ve gained in the process.</span></p>"}
