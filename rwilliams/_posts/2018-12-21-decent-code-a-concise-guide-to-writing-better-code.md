Where does one start when looking to write better code? And how do we maintain code quality and consistency when working in a team?

Code review is a great way of doing these, through feedback and sharing of knowledge. It is however a reactive approach, tends not to be done consistently, and is hard to scale well. By having, and through creating/adapting, a shared reference for practices and quality, a team can go some way towards overcoming these issues.

It’s rarely practical for everyone or any one person to review every single line of code, while also getting on with their own work and responsibilities. As reviewers we all have our own experience, technical/project knowledge, and proficiency level. We can get more out of these through sharing them with others, than by individually applying our own.

This is a personal guide, based on some of the things I look out for. Not everyone will agree with all of it, but I think it’s mostly reasonable.
